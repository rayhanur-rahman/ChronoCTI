# The WebKit exploit
The exploit used to gain code execution in the browser is quite complex and had more than 1,000 lines of code once formatted nicely. It’s interesting to note that some code, which suggests the vulnerability could also have been exploited on iOS and even on PAC-enabled (Pointer Authentication Code) devices such as the iPhone XS and newer, has been commented out, as seen in Figure 5.




We have confirmed that the patch identified by Google TAG does fix the vulnerability. While it is possible this vulnerability was assigned CVE-2021-1789, we couldn’t confirm due to the lack of publicly available technical details. Below we outline our understanding of how the vulnerability affects Safari versions prior to 14.1.

The exploit implements two primitives to gain memory read and write access: one to leak the address of an object (addrof) and one to create a fake JavaScript object from a given memory address (fakeobj). Using these two functions, the exploit creates two arrays of different types that overlap in memory, and thus is able to set a value in one of them that is treated as a pointer when accessed using the other. The technique is well described by Samuel Groß in his multiple publications on the subject. Below we explain the vulnerability that made the leakage of object addresses possible.

The exploit relies on a side effect caused by modifying an object property to be accessible via a “getter” function while enumerating the object’s properties in JIT-compiled code. The JavaScript engine erroneously speculates that the value of the property is cached in an array and is not the result of calling the getter function. We have extracted the relevant part of the code that enables the addrof primitive, which you can see in Figure 6. Comments starting with (e)r are from ESET Research.


# Figure 6. Commented excerpt of the exploit enabling the leak of object addresses

The first corruption happening here is the result of bar(vic). The function will return a pointer to a JSCell object (to be more precise, a GetterSetter), which should never be accessible from the JavaScript code. Here is the result of describe(bar(vic)) in a JavaScriptCore console:



This JSCell is then converted to a JSObject by calling the JavaScript Object function. Internally, this results in calling the JSCell’s toObject method. There is no implementation for converting a GetterSetter to a JSObject and the code will eventually fall back and assume its type is a Symbol. The GetterSetter will erroneously be cast to a Symbol. You may have noticed the assertion that the cell type is a Symbol before performing the cast in the code; however, the ASSERT macro in WebKit is compiled out of release builds.

In memory, the location of getter[0] is the same as this corrupted symbol’s value. Thus, reassigning a value to getter[0] will change the value of the symbol. Its value is fetched from JavaScript using its toString method.

The updated JavaScriptCore code now checks whether the object contains properties with GetterSetter after the property enumeration, before considering whether the object’s attribute can be accessed “quickly”.

Detailing the fake object creation would require an article of its own. In short, it abuses the same bug, although this time the object is manipulated in a way that the JIT-compiled code accesses an item that is out-of-bounds and returns an address that was carefully sprayed on the heap before the fetch.

The rest of the code allows bypassing mitigations, such as the Gigacage, and loads the next stage.

As explained by Google TAG, the JavaScript loads a Mach-O executable file in memory. The rudimentary loader does not implement importing symbols from external libraries; instead, the addresses of dlopen and dlsym are patched into the loaded Mach-O. These can then be used from the executable to dynamically load and get the addresses of functions from external libraries.

# Privilege escalation to root
Now that code execution has been gained, the next stage is a Mach-O that is loaded into memory and executed. This Mach-O exploits a local privilege escalation vulnerability to run the next stage as root. Our examination confirms Google’s analysis that the exploited vulnerability was described by Xinru Chi and Tielei Wang in a presentation at zer0con 2021, but it was also presented in more details at MOSEC 2021 by Tielei Wang. The vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2021-30869. Figure 7 shows a call to a function Tielei Wang called adjust_port_type in his last presentation. This function, responsible for changing the internal type of a Mach port, is implemented the same way in the Mach-O as was presented at MOSEC. Changing the type of a Mach port shouldn’t be possible unless a vulnerability exists.


To summarize, the Mach-O does the following:
- Downloads a file from the URL supplied as an argument
- Decrypts this file using AES-128-EBC and TEA with a custom delta
- Writes the resulting file to $TMPDIR/airportpaird and makes it executable
- Uses the privilege escalation exploit to remove the com.apple.quarantineattribute from the file to avoid asking the user to confirm the launch of the unsigned executable
- Uses the same privilege escalation to launch the next stage with root privileges

The decrypted payload is where our analysis differs the most from what was described by Google TAG: the payload delivered to vulnerable visitors to the D100 site was new macOS malware we’ve named DazzleSpy.

# DazzleSpy
DazzleSpy is a full-featured backdoor that provides attackers a large set of functionalities to control, and exfiltrate files from, a compromised computer. Our sample is a Mach-O binary file compiled for x86_64 CPU architecture.

# Persistence
In order to persist on the compromised device, the malware adds a Property List file (plist; see Figure 8) named com.apple.softwareupdate.plist to the LaunchAgents folder. The malware executable file is named softwareupdate and saved in the $HOME/.local/ folder.




# C&C communications
DazzleSpy connects to a hardcoded C&C server; the IP address and port found in the sample we decrypted was 88.218.192[.]128:5633. At first, the malware performs a TLS handshake, then uses a custom protocol to exchange JSON objects to deliver commands from the C&C server to compromised Macs. DazzleSpy’s binary contains an X.509 certificate used as a certificate authority (CA). It verifies that the server’s certificate is issued by that authority. In practice, the same self-signed certificate is used for both the CA and the C&C server. The technique protects the malware’s communications from potential eavesdropping by refusing to send data if end-to-end encryption is not possible.
