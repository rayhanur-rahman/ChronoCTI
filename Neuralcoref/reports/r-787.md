# Campaign

In this email campaign, instead of relying on attachments, the attackers included links to what appeared to be a legitimate Google Docs document, which itself contained links to malicious files hosted on Google Drive or, in some cases, hosted elsewhere. In some previous phishing email campaigns, attackers leveraged SendGrid to distribute the initial emails to hide the Google Drive links in the documents behind a SendGrid URL as a way to bypass traditional defences.

Samples of emails that we have seen are shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2.



The link in both emails is a Google Docs link claiming to host a PDF file with a list of employees that have been terminated, as shown in Figure 3.



The link in the Google Doc redirects to the URL unitedyfl[.]com/print_preview.exe to download the malware payload.

Although, the use of target names with actuating themes is not new to this group, there has been a significant uptick in the number of emails received and this campaign has been persistently active for the past few weeks.

# Packer

In most cases, the payload that is downloaded is the Bazar malware but, in some cases, it is the Buer loader. The packer used in both malware payloads is identical. Most notably, the packed binaries are exe files with a randomly named export function. The export function is responsible for payload decryption and injection.

First, a shellcode is decrypted, which further decrypts a headerless PE loader that has the final payload in its overlay. The headersless loader allocates memory, maps the payload into memory with proper permissions, and finally transfers control to it. In this campaign, no process self-injection is used to load the payload.


# Bazar loader and Bazar backdoor

The Bazar backdoor is a new stealthy malware, part of the TrickBot group’s toolkit arsenal and leveraged for high-value targets. The Bazar loader is used to download and execute the Bazar backdoor on the target system. The goal of this backdoor is to execute binaries, scripts, modules, kill processes, and then remove itself from the compromised machine. The samples used in this campaign heavily rely on control flow obfuscation. The detailed analysis report about this backdoor can be found here.

The Bazar loader downloads the Bazar backdoor from the C&C using the following URI format: {C&C}/api/v\d{3}

The downloaded payload is XOR-encrypted and can be decrypted using the script provided in the appendix.

The downloaded malware was successfully captured by the Zscaler Cloud Sandbox: Figure 6: The Zscaler Cloud Sandbox report.



The C&C TLS communications of the Bazar backdoor have been using certificates created in the same manner that TrickBot certificates have been created. The C&C server TLS certificate is shown in Figure 7.



Researchers also observed that the backdoor downloads and executes the Cobalt Strike pentesting and post-exploitation toolkit on the victim's machine within some period of time after the infection. By deploying Cobalt Strike, it is clear that this stealthy backdoor is being used to gain a foothold in corporate networks so that ransomware can be deployed, data can be stolen, or network access could be sold to other threat actors.

# Buer loader

The Buer loader was first discovered around the end of 2019. It is a very capable malware written in C and primarily sold on Russian underground forums for around US$400. Notably, this malware does not function in the CIS. It has most of the important strings encrypted and APIs are loaded by hash, just like most of the sophisticated malware these days. We are not going to go into technical details because detailed analysis of this has already published.

The Buer loader was captured by the Zscaler Cloud Sandbox.



In addition to sandbox detections, Zscaler’s multilayered cloud security platform detects indicators at various levels:
