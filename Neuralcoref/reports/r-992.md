# Technical Analysis

During our research, we observed a spearphishing email allegedly from a government agency.

The email attempts to convince recipients to click the URL and download a malicious file. We have seen that one of two files may be downloaded, one being a .PDF file and the other an .RTF file.

As with the spearphishing email, the lure documents' content attempts to convince the victim to click on another malicious URL and download a .ZIP file.

The .ZIP file contains a copy of a legitimate remote administration software developed by RemoteUtilities and provides remote administration capabilities, including:
- Downloading and uploading files
- Grabbing screenshots
- Browsing files and directories
- Executing and terminating processes

During our research, we were able to discover multiple .ZIP files used to distribute the RemoteUtilities remote administration software in the manner above, with all of these distributing the same RemoteUtilities sample. The use of this tool differentiates this particular campaign from earlier research, as in previous attacks ScreenConnect was used. Otherwise, the TTPs in use remain broadly similar.

# RemoteUtilities Analysis

When the RemoteUtilities software is executed, its process launches msiexec.exe with the following command:
The MSI installer installs a service on the victim machine called Remote Utilities â€“ Host:The service then communicates with the domain id.remoteutilities.com, which belongs to RemoteUtilities. This connection is related to one of its features called Internet-ID Connection. This feature allows an intermediary Internet server to broker the connection, similar to a proxy server. This allows the threat actor to connect to the Internet-ID server, which then connects to the actual RemoteUtilities host.

# Post-Exploitation Analysis

During our research, we discovered a compromised host in Saudi Arabia that used ScreenConnect remote administration software. They were targeted via a malicious .ZIP file (SHA256 hash: b2f429efdb1801892ec8a2bcdd00a44d6ee31df04721482a1927fc6df554cdcf) that contained a ScreenConnect executable (SHA256 hash: 2f429efdb1801892ec8a2bcdd00a44d6ee31df04721482a1927fc6df554cdcf)

As noted above, the ScreenConnect executable connects to the Internet-ID server, which is located at instance-sy9at2-relay.screenconnect.com and resolves to 51.68.244.39.

The same domain was mentioned in the previous research. We then observed the threat actors interact with the compromised host using the ScreenConnect software, executing the following commands.



The command above allows the attacker to get all the users from the domain controller.

The next command executed is the following:



This is a command to execute a PowerShell script of some kind. However, we did not have access to the a.ps1 file. We are not sure what functionality is provided here.

The next command issued is the following:



The command is connected to 187.236.212[.]184 and downloads a file called SharpChisel.exe (SHA256: 61f83466b512eb12fc82441259a5205f076254546a7726a2e3e983011898e4e2) and saves the file to the C:\programdata directory. The name SharpChisel may be related to the purpose of this file, which is a C# wrapper for a tunneling tool called chisel. The above IP address is geolocated to a server in Iran.

The following command then configures SharpChisel:



This directs all traffic to the localhost at port 9999 to the same remote server.

Another instance of SharpChisel with different settings is executed, this time using PowerShell using the following command line:



This time, traffic will be forwarded to the server over port 443.

A third SharpChisel instance that connects to a different C&C server at 23.95.215.100:8080 is started via the following command:



It is then configured with the following command line PowerShell command:



We believe that the threat actor was unable to configure SharpChisel to work correctly. The use of the following command provides additional evidence to support our assumption:



The command connects to the C&C server, downloads procdump64.exe, and saves the file in the C:\programdata directory. That supports our assumption that SharpChisel could not be configured correctly, and the attacker instead used PowerShell to download and run the legitimate procdump64.exe utility.

This was done using two separate commands:



We then see the threat actor again attempting to use SharpChisel several times using the following command:



We conclude that a tunneling connection to the C&C server could not be established, even after attempts to do so with two different tools.

Following the unsuccessful attempt to configure a tunnel connection to their C&C server, the threat actors downloaded a remote access tool (RAT) and attempted to configure it. The following PowerShell command was used for this:



The command downloads out1.exe and saves the file in the C:\users\public\ directory. Using a UPX unpacker, we were able to extract the contents, which consists of a Python executable. We then decompiled the python executable using pyinstxtractor.py to get all of the Python bytecode files. These are then decompiled to get the original python code using easypythondecompiler.

The out1.exe RAT has the following capabilities:
- Data encoding
- Email parsing
- File and registry copy
- HTTP/S connection support
- Native command line
- Process and file execution

After this, the file C:\users\public\Browser64.exe is run. Browser64 is a tool that extracts credentials from the following applications: Chrome, Chromium, Firefox, Opera, Internet Explorer, Outlook

Following the use of browser64.exe, we observed the following command being executed:



They again attempted to use SharpChisel with no success:



Finally, we observed a persistence mechanism being set using the following commands:


We were able to get a copy of newsblog.js, which is a simple VBS downloader that communicates with the following URL: hxxp://23[.]95[.]215[.]100:8008/index.jsp/7e95a3d753cc4a17793ef9513e030b49/4t2Fg7k6wWRnKgd9

The script sets up a new HTTP object and then tries to disable the system's local proxy settings. The script then executes an HTTP GET request to the C&C URL, grabs the server's response, and sleeps for 10 seconds.

At the time of our analysis, this server was still available. The response from the server contains an encoded PowerShell script, which is executed in memory. Decoding this script reveals that it contains a backdoor:

The screenshot above shows an abbreviated view of the in-memory PowerShell backdoor. The PowerShell backdoor has the following capabilities.
- Check for Skype connectivity
- Download and install Skype
- Encoded communication with its C2
- Execute commands sent from the C2 server
- Get multifactor authentication settings
- Get the currently logged on user and OS version
