# Overview of the attack
Targets are approached with spearphishing emails that contain a link to a ZIP file hosted on Google Drive. That archive contains several LNK (aka shortcut) files that extract and execute a malicious JavaScript component, while displaying a decoy document. These shortcut files have “double extensions” to try to trick the user into opening them, thinking they are benign documents or pictures (in Windows, file extensions for known file types are hidden by default). The contents of one of the ZIP files are shown in Figure 1.

Once a shortcut file is opened (it doesn’t matter which one, as they all do the same thing), it looks in the contents of its own file for lines with a specific marker and writes them to a .js file. Then this malicious JavaScript file is executed and it writes and opens a decoy file with the same name as the shortcut, but with the correct extension. It also deletes the shortcut file. The documents used as decoys are mostly photos of credit cards, identity documents, or bills with proof of address, as many financial institutions require these documents from their customers when they join, according to regulations (this is known as “Know Your Customer”). One such decoy is shown in Figure 2 (blurred for privacy).


These decoy documents seem genuine, and we assume that they have been collected by this group during years of operation. Documents are collected actively in the group’s current operations, as it targets technical support representatives and account managers, who regularly receive these kinds of documents from their customers. The group reuses the documents on different targets, unless the targets are from different regions.

The JavaScript component is the first stage of the attack and can deploy other malware such as a C# spy component, Golden Chickens components or several Python-based tools. The name Evilnum was given to the C# component by other researchers in the past, but the JS component also has been referred to as Evilnum. We have named the group Evilnum as that is the name of their flagship malware, and we’ll refer to the various malware pieces as components. An overview of these is shown in Figure 3.


Each of the various components has its own C&C server, and each component operates independently. The operators of the malware manually send commands to install additional components and use post-compromise scripts and tools if they consider them necessary.

Most servers used by the malware are referenced by IP addresses; domain names have not been used. The only exceptions are the C&C servers used by the Golden Chickens components; malware purchased from a MaaS provider, as we describe later.

Those referenced by an IP address can be split into two groups, based on the hosting provider. The majority of them are hosted with FreeHost, a Ukrainian provider. The rest are hosted in the Netherlands, with Dotsi.

# JS Component: First compromise
This component communicates with a C&C server and acts as a backdoor without the need for any additional program. However, in most attacks that we have seen, the attackers deployed additional components as they saw fit and used the JS malware only as a first stage.

The first known mention of this JavaScript malware was in May 2018 in this pwncode article. The malware has changed since then and we illustrate these changes in Figure 4.


Differences between version 1.3 and the others are noteworthy, as the server-side code for the C&C was changed and commands are different. In that early version it was not possible to upload files to the C&C, only to download files to the victim’s computer. Also, as new versions appeared, the malware was extended with some Python scripts (see the Post-compromise toolset section) and external tools such as ChromeCookiesView.

Despite the differences, the core functionalities remain the same in all versions, including the retrieval of the C&C server’s address from GitHub, GitLab or Reddit pages created specifically for that purpose. Figure 5 shows an example of a Reddit page that is parsed by the malware to retrieve a C&C address.


This component achieves persistence through the Run registry key and has full backdoor capabilities: it can download and execute binaries, run arbitrary commands or upload files from the victim computer to the C&C server. We will not go into details about the technical aspects of this component, as a good analysis of the latest version was published recently by Prevailion.

# C# Component: Evil, not so evil
In March 2019, Palo Alto Networks described malware with very similar functionality to the JS component, but coded in C#. That version (2.5) obtained the address of its C&C by dividing a number by 666, and was therefore named Evilnum by Palo Alto Networks researchers. Since then there have been new versions of the C# malware, the latest of them being version 4.0, which we first saw in April 2020. The number 666 is not used anymore and the PDB paths of the executables show that the developers call their malware “Marvel”. However, we will continue to name the malware Evilnum to avoid creating confusion.

The latest version comes bundled in an MSI file (Windows Installer) and runs independent of the JS component. Furthermore, it has different C&Cs than the JS component. However, in all cases that we have seen, the C# component was downloaded and executed after the JavaScript malware gained initial access. The structure of this component is shown in Figure 6.

 
When the MSI file is executed, three malicious components, along with some .NET Framework library files, are written to disk in %LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Mediia. The file copier is the first to be executed and its only purpose is to move the files to another location in %LOCALAPPDATA% (see the Indicators of Compromise section for the folder names). The loader is then executed and it loads and decrypts the contents of the file System.Memmory.dll, which is the actual malicious payload (DLL Agent) for the C# component. AES encryption is used for the DLL and for obfuscation of the strings in the payload. The same key and initialization vector are used to encrypt the strings in all of the different versions.

The IP address of the C&C server is hardcoded and in plain text. A GET request is sent for /Validate/valsrv and if the response body contains the text youwillnotfindthisanywhare, then the server is accepted. Otherwise, a GitLab page is parsed to get the IP address of a second server.

The following capabilities are present in version 4.0:

Take screenshots if the mouse has been moved in a period of time, and send them to the C&C, base64 encoded. The image is stored in a file called SC4.P7D
- Run commands
- Run other binaries via cmd.exe
- Send information such as computer name, username and antivirus installed
- Persist in a compromised system by creating registry keys
