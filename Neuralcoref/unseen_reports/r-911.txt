Blue Mockingbird is the name we’ve given to a cluster of similar activity we’ve observed involving Monero cryptocurrency-mining payloads in dynamic-link library (DLL) form on Windows systems. They achieve initial access by exploiting public-facing web applications, specifically those that use Telerik UI for ASP.NET, followed by execution and persistence using multiple techniques (check out my colleague Jesse Brown’s new blog for details on Blue Mockingbird’s COR_PROFILER persistence mechanism). During at least one incident, the adversary used proxying software and experimented with different kinds of reverse shell payloads to connect to external systems. The earliest Blue Mockingbird tools we’ve observed were created in December 2019.

Gaining entry

In at least two incident response (IR) engagements, Blue Mockingbird has exploited public-facing web applications (T1190: Exploit Public-Facing Application) that implemented Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX. This suite of user interface components accelerates the web development process, but some versions are susceptible to a deserialization vulnerability, CVE-2019-18935. The exploitation of this CVE is not unique to Blue Mockingbird, but it has been a common point of entry.

In exploiting this vulnerability, two DLLs are uploaded to a web application running on a Windows IIS web server. In telemetry, investigators will notice w3wp.exe writing the DLLs to disk and then immediately loading them into memory afterward. In some cases, this will cause w3wp.exe to temporarily freeze and fail to successfully serve HTTP responses.
