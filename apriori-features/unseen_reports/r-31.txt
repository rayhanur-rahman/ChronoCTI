The Cybereason Nocturnus Team has been tracking various North Korean threat actors, among them the cyber espionage group known as Kimsuky, (aka: Velvet Chollima, Black Banshee and Thallium), which has been active since at least 2012 and is believed to be operating on behalf of the North Korean regime. The group has a rich and notorious history of offensive cyber operations around the world, including operations targeting South Korean think tanks, but over the past few years they have expanded their targeting to countries including the United States, Russia and various nations in Europe. Some of their observed targets include:

• Pharmaceutical/Research companies working on COVID-19 vaccines and therapies

• UN Security Council

• South Korean Ministry of Unification

• Various Human Rights Groups

• South Korean Institute for Defense Analysis

• Various Education and Academic Organizations

• Various Think Tanks

• Government Research Institutes

• Journalists covering Korean Peninsula relations

• South Korean Military

On October 27th, the US-CERT published a report summarizing Kimusky’s recent activities and describing the group’s TTPs and infrastructure.

Combining the information in the report with the intelligence accumulated by Cybereason Nocturnus over time, the researchers discovered a previously undocumented modular spyware suite dubbed KGH_SPY that provides Kimsuky with stealth capabilities to carry out espionage operations.

In addition, Cybereason Nocturnus uncovered another new malware strain dubbed CSPY Downloader that was observed to be a sophisticated tool with extensive anti-analysis and evasion capabilities, allowing the attackers to determine if “the coast is clear” before downloading additional payloads.

Lastly, the Cybereason Nocturnus team identified new server infrastructure used by Kimsuky that overlaps with previously identified Kimsuky infrastructure.

• Anti-Forensics: The creation/compilation timestamps of malware in the report appear to have been tampered with and backdated to 2016 in an attempt to thwart forensic investigation

• Behavioral and Code Similarities to Other Kimsuky Malware: The newly discovered malware shares various behavioral and code similarities to known Kimsuky malware, including: code signing with EGIS revoked certificate; shared strings; file naming convention; string decryption algorithms; PDB paths referencing authors / projects

• Undetected by Antivirus: At the time of writing this report, some of the mentioned payloads are not detected by any antivirus vendors

Kimsuky Infrastructure Overlap

Kimsuky is known for their complex infrastructure that uses free-registered domains, compromised domains, as well as private domains registered by the group. Tracking down the infrastructure, the Nocturnus team was able to detect overlaps with BabyShark malware and other connections to different malware such as AppleSeed backdoor:

Infrastructure graph for different Kimsuky’s domains and the overlaps between them

Throughout the years, Kimsuky has been using an array of malware in their operations. The infrastructure of some of the malware used by Kimsuky can be tracked using pattern analysis of the URI structures used by some of their tools. The following table maps commonly observed URI patterns to their respective malware:

New toolset Infrastructure

By tracking the previous infrastructure and correlating the data regarding the URI patterns used by different Kimsuky tools, the Cybereason Nocturnus Team was able to uncover a new infrastructure that was used by the new malware toolset:

Phishing Themes related to the New Infrastructure

When analyzing the weaponized phishing documents that were connected to the new tools infrastructure, one can notice the topic of human rights in the North Korea repeated in at least two documents:

PM_Abe_draft_letter_on_UN_NK_20200130.doc - This document contains what appears to be a letter in English and Japanese that was addressed to the (now former) Prime minister of Japan, Shinzo Abe, regarding the subject of human rights in North Korea.

Back to the Future: Suspected Anti-Forensics

Backdating, or timestomping, is a technique used by many threat actors which involves the manipulation of the creation timestamps or compilation date of a file in order to thwart analysis attempts (anti-forensics). It is suspected that the creation date of most of the files mentioned in this report were tampered with by the threat actors and backdated to 2016:

Name SHA-256 Creation Date (likely fake) VT Upload Date m1.dll cur_install_x64.dll af13b16416760782ec81d587736cb4c9b2e7099afc10cb764eeb4c 922ee8802f 2016-10-02 07:35:25 2020-10-07 13:03:45 msic.exe

The assumption is backed by the registration dates of the domains that were hardcoded in all the above mentioned malware samples. According to the domain registration information in RiskIQ PassiveTotal, these domains were first registered between January 2019 to August 2020, years after the seemingly manipulated creation dates:

KGH Spyware Suite





The connection between different components of the KGH malware suite

During our analysis, Cybereason Nocturnus discovered a new malware suite dubbed “KGH” which contains several modules used as spyware. The name “KGH” is derived from the PDB path and internal names found in the malware samples:

“KGH” in an internal name of the backdoor

“m.dll” pdb path

A possible link to North Korean attacks referencing the name “KGH” was mentioned in 2017 in a research by Ahnlab, however it is unclear whether it is related to the same malware authors.

Infection Vector: Weaponized Word Documents

The infection vector seems to originate from a Word documents containing malicious macros:

Name SHA-256 Domain Creation Date (likely fake) VT Upload Date 0807.dotm 97d4898c4e70335f0adbbace34593236cb 84e849592e5971a797554d3605d323 csv.posadadesantiago.com 2016-08-07 11:31:00 2020-08-19 09:46:33 0928.dotm d88c5695ccd83dce6729b84c8c43e8a804 938a7ab7cfeccaa0699d6b1f81c95c csv.posadadesantiago.com 2016-09-28 02:08:00 2020-10-06 07:53:38



We observed two Word documents that communicate with the domains above which contain code similarities to each other and to the previously mentioned “Interview with a north korean defector.doc”. The macros of the malicious documents do the following:

0807.dotm:

1. Drops a script named “winload.x” and a wscript.exe binary renamed as “cs.exe” to “%appdata%\Micorosoft\Templates”.

2. Sets the reg key “HKCU\Environment\UserInitMprLogonScript” to run a cmd command that copies “winload.x” as “a.vbs”, executes it and deletes “a.vbs”. The mentioned registry key is used to execute Logon Scripts, and will execute what is written to it at startup. The document is using this key to achieve persistence for the file “winload.x”:





Persistence using UserInitMprLogonScript Registry keys

3. Collects system, network and drive information and installed applications, saves it to a file named “info” and sends it to the C2 using iexplorer.exe





4. When “winload.x” (“a.vbs”) is executed, it tries to download and execute code from “csv.posadadesantiago[.]com/home?act=news&id=[Machine_name]”:





Winload.x (a.vbs) contents deobfuscated

0928.dotm:

1. Collects information about the infected system, network, drives, and installed applications.





2. Saves the collected information to a file named “info” in “%appdata%\Micorosoft\Templates” and sends it to the C2.





3. Downloads m1.dll (KGH Installer) from “csv.posadadesantiago[.]com/home?id=[Machine_name]&act=sbk&ver=x64”

4. Downloads m.dll (KGH-Browser Stealer) from “csv.posadadesantiago[.]com/home?id=[Machine_name]&act=wbi&ver=x64”





5. Executes the KGH installer:





URLs creation from 0928.dotm macro code

Both documents use similar function names and variable names:

0928.dotm VB code (left) & 0807.dotm VB code (right)

Once the macro collected all the information, it sends the data to the C2 server over an HTTP POST request:

KGH Spyware Payloads Overview

The following payloads were observed to be downloaded and dropped by the previously mentioned malicious documents:

Analysis of the KGH Installer (M1.dll)

The KGH installer was uploaded to VirusTotal in October 2020 and at the time of writing this report is not detected by any Antivirus engines:

KGH installer detections in VT

The file is a DLL that executes the installation / dropper code located in the “outinfo” export:

KGH installer exports

The DLL contains two encrypted blobs in its resource section. It can be noticed that there are traces of Korean language in those resources:

KGH installer resources

These encrypted blobs are dropped to C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Temp\3f34a.tmp one after the other. Once they are dropped, the dropper also decrypts them and writes them to a newly created folder and creates persistence:

C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\AreSoft\msic.exe

C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\AreSoft\msfltr32.dll





Dropped files location on an infected machine

The backdoor achieves persistence by creating the following registry autoruns keys:

Key: HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows\Load

HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows\Load Value: C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\AreSoft\msic.exe





Analysis of the KGH Backdoor Loader (msic.exe)

The KGH loader (msic.exe) is responsible for loading and executing the KGH backdoor DLL (msfltr32.dll) in memory:

Msic.exe loads msfltr32.dll to memory

The file itself is unsigned and masquerades as a legitimate Microsoft Windows tool:

Msfltr32.dll Signature Info

KGH Backdoor - Main Module (msfltr32.dll)

The msfltr32.dll module is the core module of the KGH backdoor. The backdoor contains the following functionality:

• Persistence using autorun keys

Persistence using autorun keys • Keylogger

Keylogger • Directory and file listing

Directory and file listing • Downloading secondary payloads from the C2 server

Downloading secondary payloads from the C2 server • Exfiltrating collected information from the host to the C2 server

Exfiltrating collected information from the host to the C2 server • Executing arbitrary commands via cmd.exe or PowerShell

KGH Backdoor: Keylogger Functionality

The KGH backdoor has a keylogger functionality built into its code, which is achieved by a common technique of polling the GetAsyncKeyState() function:

Excerpt from KGH’s Keylogger function

The recorded keystrokes are stored in the “lg” folder in %appdata% with the file extension “.x”

KGH Backdoor Secondary Payloads

The KGH backdoor contacts the C2 with URL “csv.posadadesantiago[.]com/home?act=news&id=[Machine_name]” and saves the response to “C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Temp

.x”:

URL string in KGH Backdoor

The KGH backdoor will then parse the contents of “n.x”. The “n.x” file may contain an “SHL”, “DLL” or “EXE” file.

In case it is a “DLL” or an “EXE” the KGH backdoor will execute the file. In case the downloaded file contains an “SHL” file, the KGH backdoor will parse the file to retrieve commands sent by the C2:

Check “n.x” file type code from KGH backdoor

KGH Backdoor Commands

The KGH backdoor has a predefined set of commands that it receives from the server:

KGH’s backdoor commands

Command Purpose upf Uploads files to the C2 tre Create a list of all files in the system using the “tree” command, save to a file named “c.txt” and upload the file to the C2 wbi Download “m.dll” browser stealer module and exfiltrates stolen data cmd Execute a cmd shell command pws Execute a powershell command

List of files generated by or downloaded by the KGH backdoor:

File Purpose C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\lg\[year_month_day].x Keylogger stolen data storage C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Temp

.x Payload downloaded from the server C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Temp\C.txt Output of tree command (directory and files listing) C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /c tree /f C:\ >> C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Temp\C.txt C:\Users\user\Documents\w.x Stolen browser data (from m.dll module) sig.x Likely checks write permission to the disk C:\test1.txt N/A

KGH Infostealer Module (m.dll)

Another component of the KGH suite is the m.dll module, which is an information stealer that harvest data from browsers, Windows Credential Manager, WINSCP and mail clients. The infostealer module is not detected by any AV vendor at the time of writing this report:

KGH infostealer module is undetected by any Antivirus vendors

The PDB path embedded in the m.dll module further shows a clear connection to the KGH backdoor, as it is named “KGH_Browser-Master”:

E:\SPY\WebBrowser\KGH_Browser-Master\x64\Release\KGH_Browser-Master.pdb

The “SPY” user was also observed in PDB of the “CSPY Downloader”, which is also mentioned in this report:

PDB Path of the CSPY Downloader

The infostealer module steals information stored (cookies, credentials) in the following applications:

• Browsers: Chrome, IE / Edge, Firefox, Opera

• WinSCP Client

• Windows Credential Manager

• Mozilla Thunderbird Mail Client





Main Infostealing routine

The stolen information is written to a file called “w.x”:

CSPY Downloader - A New Downloader in the Arsenal

When hunting for some of the URI patterns mentioned in the US-CERT report (“/home/dwn.php?van=101”), another malicious executable was found communicating with the C2 wave.posadadesantiago[.]com, named winload.exe.

This sample was delivered by a malicious document named “Interview with a north Korean defector”. The macro embedded inside unpacks and executes winload.exe.

Upon analysis, the Nocturnus determined that winload.exe is a new type of a downloader, dubbed “CSPY” by Cybereason, that is packed with robust evasion techniques meant to ensure that the “coast is clear” and that the malware does not run in a context of a virtual machine or analysis tools before it continues to download secondary payloads:

VirusTotal uploads of winload.exe communicating with the above mentioned C2

This file is mentioned in the report by ESTSecurity. In alignment with the findings there, it is packed with UPX, has resources in Korean, Anti-VM functionality and a timestamp that is tempered to July 30, 2016:

The PDB Path of the CSPY Downloader

PDB Path and resources of the malware

The file is also signed with the following revoked certificate. As can be seen, the signing date may be fake as well. EGIS Co., Ltd certificate issuer was previously reported to be used by Kimsuky:

Kimsuky’s typical revoked certificate

When further examining the file, some interesting functionality can be found. Indicative strings and API calls can be decrypted by deducting 1 from each character, similar to the KGH backdoor whose strings can be decrypted by deducting 5 from each character. When decrypting the strings, the malware’s full logs are revealed. The log file is stored in %appdata%\microsoft\NTUSERS.log:

Decrypted logging strings of CSPY Downloader

It is interesting to note that some of the abovementioned log strings are grammatically incorrect, which can suggest that the malware author is not a native English speaker.

The above logs imply that this sample might be a debug version of the malware. In many cases, debug versions are used by the malware authors for testing new malware or new features. This can also suggest that the malware is newly developed and has not been fully operationalized yet. Another clue that points to this assumption is that some parts of the malware code seem to be buggy or incomplete.

Anti-analysis Techniques

Prior to downloading secondary payloads, CSPY Downloader initiates an extensive series of checks to determine if it is being debugged or running in a virtual environment, by searching for specific virtualization-related loaded modules, the process PEB structure, various file paths, registry keys, and memory:

A list of methods performing anti-analysis checks by the malware

It is worth mentioning that the document which unpacks CSPY Downlader, runs an almost identical series of Anti-VM techniques prior to dropping the downloader, which highlights the attackers’ efforts to avoid detection and remain under-the-radar.

After the anti-analysis checks are complete, the loader starts preparing the infected environment for the downloading of additional payloads. There are 3 download attempts (and thus 3 GET requests trailing by a different numeric ID), the payloads are downloaded subsequently to the user’s %temp% folder.

Payloads download method

After downloading the payloads, they are moved and renamed. The whole process can be summarized as follows:

Download URI Filename Copied To Purpose dwn.php?van=10860 dwn.dat0 %temp%\Appx.exe Main executable dwn.php?van=101 dwn.dat1 C:\Users\Public\Documents\AppxUp\BSup.hf Possible module dwn.php?van=102 dwn.dat2 C:\Users\Public\Documents\AppxUp\BCup.hf Possible module

To execute the main downloaded payload, the loader tries to masquerade as a legitimate Windows service, claiming in its fake description, that it is used to support packed applications:

Registering the freshly downloaded malware as a service

In order to avoid raising suspicions from the victim, CSPY Downloader exploits a known UAC bypass technique that uses the SilentCleanup task to execute the binary with elevated privileges.

Using schtasks utility to disable UAC

As part of the exploitation process, the above value will be written to the registry under the %windir% variable, and deleted after execution. Appx.exe is moved once again, this time to %programdata%\Microsoft\Windows and registered as a service.

Finally, CSpy will initiate its self-deletion method.

Conclusion

In this report we uncovered a new toolset infrastructure that is used by the Kimsuky group, a notorious activity group that has been operating on behalf of the North Korean regime since 2012. A close examination of the new infrastructure combined with pattern-analysis led Cybereason’s Nocturnus team to the discovery of the “KGH Spyware Suite”, a modular malware likely involved in recent espionage operations, and the “CSPY Downloader” - both were previously undocumented.

In addition, our report shows certain interesting overlaps between older Kimsuky malware and servers and the newly discovered malware and infrastructure. Moreover, the report highlights several behavior-based and code similarities between the new malware samples and older known Kimsuky malware and TTPs.

Throughout the report it is noticeable that the threat actors invested efforts in order to remain under the radar, by employing various anti-forensics and anti-analysis techniques which included backdating the creation/compilation time of the malware samples to 2016, code obfuscation, anti-VM and anti-debugging techniques. At the time of writing this report, some of the samples mentioned in the report are still not detected by any AV vendor.

While the identity of the victims of this campaign remains unclear, there are clues that can suggest that the infrastructure targeted organizations dealing with human rights violations. At the time of writing this report, there is not enough information available to Cybereason to determine this with a high certainty, and in any case, there could be a wide range of industries, organizations and individuals that were targeted by Kimsuky using this infrastructure.
