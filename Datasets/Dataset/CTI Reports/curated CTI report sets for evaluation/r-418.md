# Initial Access

Spearphishing Attachment (ATT&CK T1193) is one of the most used Initial Access techniques used by ransomware families as in Sodinokibi. Attackers use spam emails with an attached MS Office Word document including a malicious macro to download the ransomware to the target system. In order to show the lifecycle of Sodinokibi ransomware, we analyzed a Microsoft Word document. The specific sample analyzed below is Bewerbungsunterlagen_6704760.doc ( SHA-256: fb8b03748b617acf0ee3b138c5b37e74ec396bc73da3362d633862d7283742fd , detection rate is only 33/60 as of today). Even though Sodinokibi uses simple obfuscation techniques mentioned below, 30 of 60 antiviruses cannot detect it. “Bewerbungsunterlagen” means “application document” in German, and the attackers used a CV theme to lure victims into downloading the document. Sodinokibi is a “Ransomware-as-a-Service (RAAS) malware, so its distribution methods vary depending on the attacker distributing it. Attackers have used the following Initial Access techniques in their other campaigns to deliver Sodinokibi:

Exploit Public-Facing Application (ATT&CK T1190) : Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in enterprise applications to distribute it, such as the deserialization vulnerability CVE-2019-2725 in Oracle WebLogic Server having a CVSS score of 9.8/10.

Remote Desktop Protocol ( ATT&CK T1076) : Attackers use RDP to deliver Sodinokibi. This delivery technique can also be classified in External Remote Services ( ATT&CK T1133).

Supply Chain Compromise ( ATT&CK T1195) : Sodinokibi ransomware was distributed through a compromised version of WinRAR downloaded from the WinRAR Italia website.

Drive-by-Compromise ( ATT&CK T1189): Attackers compromised WordPress sites and injected JavaScript over the content of the original site to spread Sodinokibi.

When a victim opens the document, Microsoft Word asks to enable/disable macros. It reveals that a macro is embedded in the document (Scripting, ATT&CK T1054).

The malicious document claims that it was created in an earlier version of Microsoft Office and asks the victim to enable the content, which launches the code hidden in the macros.

# Defense Evasion

When we examined macros in the document, we saw that VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) codes were split into modules and functions for the purpose of obfuscation (Obfuscate

According to the above functions, fU1 = "hxxp://54.39.233.132/de1.trp".

As we know the fU1 and fP1 parameters, we can understand the following function:

The second parameter (fU1) is a string value that contains the URL to download, and the third parameter (fP1) is a string value containing the name or full path of the file to create for the download. Accordingly, this function downloads de1.trp from 54.39.233.132 and saves it to the C:\Windows\Temp\ directory as MicrosoftOfficeWord_upd.v.88735.34.5.exe.

The downloaded file is the Sodinokibi ransomware (SHA-256: 720fbe60f049848f02ba9b2b91926f80ba65b84f0d831a55f4e634c820bd0848, detection rate is 51/69 as of today). Its artifacts usually mimic the names of known executables for Defense Evasion, such as a Microsoft Word update file name (MicrosoftOfficeWord_upd.v.88735.34.5.exe) as in this sample (Masquerading, ATT&CK T1036).

# Execution

As seen in the above process graph, the macro in the Word document downloads and runs Sodinokibi executable. After execution, it runs the following command using cmd.exe (Command-Line Interface, ATT&CK T1059):


At first, this command runs vssadmin.exe to delete all volume shadow copies on the system to prevent recovery (Inhibit System Recovery, ATT&CK T1490) vssadmin.exe Delete Shadows /All /Quiet to delete all volume shadow copies on the system to prevent recovery (Inhibit System Recovery, ATT&CK T1490) Then, it uses bcdedit.exe twice to disable automatic Windows recovery features by modifying boot configuration data (Inhibit System Recovery, ATT&CK T1490) 

Sigma rules detecting the above actions are given in the Appendix.

# Impact

Like most ransomware, Sodinokibi encrypts files and adds a random extension such as “test.jpg.1cd8t9ahd5” (Data Encrypted for Impact, ATT&CK T1486). It also drops a ransom note in folders that contain encrypted files. The name of the ransom note is the random extension added to the encrypted files. For example, if the extension is ".1cd8t9ahd5", the ransom message filename will be called "1cd8t9ahd5-HOW-TO-DECRYPT.txt".

The ransom note recommends accessing the attacker’s website over the TOR browser: hxxp://aplebzu47wgazapdqks6vrcv6zcnjppkbxbr6wketf56nf6aq2nmyoyd.onion/C2D97495C4BA3647

When we accessed the website, we saw the following page that wants 0,6346 Bitcoin worth $5,000. If you pay the ransom in two days, the cost is halving.

In the “ABOUT US” section on their website, they claim that they developed the best data encryption and decryption system available today. I am sure they did not develop the best encryption method, but they use multiple encryption by encrypting files and also the private keys. To put it another way, it requires two keys for decryption. Sodinokibi uses AES encryption to encrypt the private keys, and Salsa20 for encrypting files. As far as I know, unfortunately there are no decryption tools to restore data encrypted by Sodinokibi ransomware.
