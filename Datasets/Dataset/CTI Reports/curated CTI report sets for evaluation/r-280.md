# Infection Vector

# Downloading and injecting TrickBot.

The attack starts with a phishing email that contains a malicious link to a file hosted on Google Docs named “Annual Bonus Report.doc”. When the user clicks on the link, the TrickBot dropper downloads onto the target machine. This differs from previous TrickBot attacks we have seen, where TrickBot is usually dropped through a Microsoft Office document or by another malware like Emotet.

# The TrickBot Downloader

The campaigns use a TrickBot downloader that is signed and uses an icon to pretend it is a Microsoft Word document. When the user double-clicks the file, they are presented with a decoy message box. To avoid suspicion, the decoy message suggests the user should update Microsoft Word or open the file from another computer.

While at first glance these files can be mistaken for legitimate Microsoft Word files, a closer inspection of the file metadata indicates they are not associated with Microsoft Word, nor are they Microsoft Word document files.

Most of the initial payloads in these campaigns are signed with valid certificates to evade security tools. They abuse the relative trust that is given to signed binaries to avoid detection.

The message box distracts the user as TrickBot’s payload is downloaded, stored in the %TEMP% folder, and executed. A new process injects the TrickBot payload into a svchost.exe process.

# The TrickBot Payload

Once TrickBot’s main payload is injected into the svchost.exe process, it carries out a series of reconnaissance-related tasks to profile the infected endpoint and the network. This information is crucial, as it determines the course of the attack.

# Checking Network Connectivity

TrickBot checks for Internet connectivity by trying to access several designated domains. These domains are preconfigured and belong to legitimate web services, including: checkip.amazonaws.com, ipecho.net, ipinfo.io, api.ipify.org, icanhazip.com, myexternalip.com, wtfismyip.com, ip.anysrc.net.

Once TrickBot verifies it can connect to the Internet, it communicates with C2 servers, some of which using TOR-related domains. It collects and sends information about where the target machine is located to the C2 servers.

# Browser History and Credential Theft

After TrickBot establishes Internet access and sends information about the location of the target machine, it starts its malicious activity. The module core-parser.dll is reflectively loaded into svchost.exe. core-parser.dll parses the TrickBot config files and extracts IP addresses for secondary C2 communication, redirection, and web injection logic.

TrickBot sends the reconnaissance information from the target machine to a hardcoded C2 server. The C2 server is responsible for handling the stolen data.

TrickBot also steals data from Internet Explorer by executing the built-in Windows tool ESENTUTL using the living-off-the-land technique (LOLBin).



This command dumps the Extensible Storage Engine (ESE) database format.

# Application-specific Credential Theft

This variant of TrickBot employs a new, unique ability to steal passwords from KeePass, a free, open- source password manager. TrickBot's KeePass stealing capabilities seem to be inspired (or even partially copy-pasted) from a publicly available tool dubbed PoshKPBrute, a script that performs a dictionary attack against KeePass .kdbx files. Once it finds the dictionary key, it dumps all passwords as an output and sends the attackers the master password.

TrickBot’s stealer module also tries to extract keys from Filezilla, OpenSSH and OpenVPN.

# Reconnaissance Commands

In addition to several crafted PowerShell commands, the attackers use several legitimate Windows processes to gather information, including nltest.exe, net.exe, ipconfig.exe, whoami.exe, and nslookup.exe. They gather information on:
- All trusted domains, domains, and domain controllers
- A list of computers and network devices on the network
- The infected machine user and groups the user belongs to
- The infected machine, including machine name, operating system, workstation domain, and more information
- Network adapters that have connected to the machine and DNS servers



The attacker also uses PowerShell to test DNS entry settings. They use the command -q=srv_kerberos_tcp on the process nslookup.exe to open an interactive shell. They use the shell to expand their search to other machines on the network by searching for things like a list of the domain controllers.

With this in mind, we gather that the attackers goal is to spread within organizations to multiple machines, not just to the target machine.

# From TrickBot Infection to Interactive Hacking

The threat actor evaluates information sent back to the C2 server and identifies if they have successfully infected a high-value target. If so, they escalate their efforts by switching to interactive hacking: reconnaissance, credential dumping, lateral movement, and in some cases the mass deployment of ransomware across endpoints connected to the domain controller.

# PowerShell Payloads

The threat actor leverages PowerShell to send additional payloads to the target machine. They issue commands to fetch a payload from a secondary server and, once it’s downloaded, immediately execute it on the target machine through PowerShell.



The northracing[.]net URL contains a PowerShell script in the contents of the webpage. Though we were unable to fetch the script used in this specific incident, we were able to pivot off the query parameters used in the above PowerShell script (?a=irs&x=) to find a sandbox report for similar activity. The PowerShell payload runs two stages: the first stage sends basic information to the C2 domain and waits for a response to see if it should continue its operation. If the threat actor does not send a stop flag, the PowerShell script runs in a constant loop and continuously POSTs data to the same domain the payload was fetched from. Each POST request is sent along with a UUID generated from the user’s hostname and the current process ID.

A POST request containing basic information about the machine is sent, which includes the current user and their domain, the root of the file system, and information about the operating system.


This information is sent to the C2 along with the `i` parameter. When a response is received, the payload checks to see if the response matches the value cex01. If it does, the PowerShell script stops executing and kills the task. If the response is any other value, the script sets a timeout variable based on the response and continues to the main loop.

This indicates that the attacker is either looking to target specific Windows domains or specific operating system versions.

The main loop sends a POST request to the server with the `t` parameter, which requests the next commands from the server.

Each line in the response from the threat actor contains a Base64-encoded command, which is decoded and then immediately executed using PowerShell through the Invoke-Expression (IEX) commandlet. The output of the command is sent back to the C2 server using a POST request with the “a” parameter.

Meterpreter & Cobalt Strike Implants

# Meterpreter Implant

The attackers use a Meterpreter implant to carry out post-exploitation actions. The Cybereason Platform detects both the shellcode and various Meterpreter DLLs reflectively loaded to memory. The detected DLLs include:
- Metsrv.dll: For Meterpreter, where the protocol and extension systems are implemented
- Ext_server_priv.x86.dll: For privilege escalation
- Ext_server_stdapi.x86.dll: A metasploit post exploitation module used for reconnaissance

Cybereason detects the reflectively loaded malicious modules as a Meterpreter agent and shellcode executed by the Meterpreter agent.

The Meterpreter agent creates a connection to port 4444 on the external IP address 91.12.89[.]129.

# Cobalt Strike Implant

Using Meterpreter, the attackers injected Cobalt Strike and other Metasploit payloads into the rundll32.exe process.

The attacker uses the following metasploit modules:
- ext_server_extapi.x86.dll : Obtains clipboard data and manipulates and decrypts the NTDS file 
- ext_server_priv.x86.dll : Performs privilege escalation
- Ext_server_stdapi.x86.dll : Performs reconnaissance activity
- Bypassuac.x64.dll: A post-exploitation module used to bypass User Account Control

Both Meterpreter and Cobalt Strike are legitimate penetration testing tools that have been repeatedly used by various threat actors, including the FIN6 threat actor.

# Active Directory Discovery using Cobalt Strike

The threat actor uses known Cobalt Strike modules to enumerate Active Directory information:

The attackers execute several Base64-encoded PowerShell commands in order to determine if the infected machine’s user is in the admin or domain admin group.

After verifying the user is an admin, the threat actor gathers information about the domain controllers and their IP addresses using an additional Base64-encoded and compressed PowerShell command.


The decoded PowerShell command that attempts to gather domain controller information.

# Active Directory Discovery using ADfind

The attackers deploys a batch script that executes the ADfind.exe tool to enumerate users, groups, and computers of the Windows domain.







The ADfind tool has reportedly been used previously in attacks related to FIN6.

# New Anchor_DNS Variant Discovered

One of the most interesting payloads in these attacks is the Anchor_DNS malware, which was originally discovered in October 2019 by NTT Security. It is classified by NTT as a variant of the infamous TrickBot malware, which uses DNS tunneling to stealthily communicate with C2 servers. Though this variant was first discovered in October 2019, there is evidence that Anchor_DNS was used as far back as March 2019.\

This new variant acts as a sophisticated, stealthy backdoor that selectively chooses high-profile targets. Anchor_DNS is still undergoing rapid development cycles with code changes and new feature updates every few weeks.

This is a new variant of Anchor_DNS that appeared as early as November 2019 and exhibits the following changes in code and behavior:
- No self-deletion mechanism shown in previous samples
- No internet connectivity checks using legitimate online web services
- A built-in capability to check for C2 availability using ICMP (ping)
- Additional partial string encryption and code obfuscation


# Static Analysis Observations

anchorDNS_x64.exe contains a PDB path with the name of the malware, Anchor_DNS. This file is the 64-bit version of Anchor_DNS, however, there were earlier instances of the 32-bit version as well. The project name shows that this is the fifth version of Anchor_DNS.

Many strings in the code have typos and grammatical mistakes, further affirming our suspicion that the authors of Anchor_DNS are not native english speakers.

The threat actor gave considerable effort to obfuscating the code of this new Anchor_DNS variant using stack strings, string encryption, and by implementing a packer. The following example shows considerable changes in the code of the WinMain() function between an older variant of Anchor_DNS and the new variant.

- -i flag: 
  - creates a scheduled task with the following naming convention (e.g “Notepad++ autoupdate#94654”): [random folder name in %APPDATA%] autoupdate#[random_number]
  - Writes NTFS ADS files ($TASK, $GUID, $FILE)
- -u flag: 
  - New Variant : executes the malware’s main communication module with the C2 
  - Old Variant: Drops a copy in %TEMP% Creates ADS files ($GUID, $FILE)
- -s flag: appears only on older versions of Anchor_DNS and runs the program without creating persistence and self-deletes once done. appears only on older versions of Anchor_DNS and runs the program without creating persistence and self-deletes once done. 
- --log=: expects a file name to write log file in C:\Users\[USER]

# C2 Communication

Older and newer versions of Anchor_DNS communicate over DNS. However, the newer version described here does not check Internet connectivity using legitimate online web services like ipinfo.io, and instead uses a built-in capability to check for the server’s availability using the ICMP protocol.

# DNS Tunneling

Anchor_DNS communicates with the C2 servers over DNS using DNS Tunneling. With this technique, Anchor_DNS can transfer data, receive commands, and download an additional payload, as detailed in NTT Security’s report on an older Anchor_DNS sample.

By implementing DNS Tunneling, Anchor_DNS can evade certain security products that might block certain network protocols or overlook DNS traffic.

# Discovery of The Anchor Malware and Its Connection to TrickBot

During our investigation, we found several unidentified malware samples related to TrickBot infections. The malware is dubbed Anchor by its authors and has been active since August 2018. Unlike Anchor_DNS, the Anchor malware does not implement communication over DNS. However, it does share many behavioral, code, and string similarities with Anchor_DNS and some similarities to TrickBot.

Many Anchor samples have a very low or at times zero detection rate by AV vendors, which could explain the limited reports about this malware.

The malware has both x86 and x64 versions and contains an installer component to install the malware.

# NTFS** ADS File - Storing the GUID

Similar to Anchor_DNS, Anchor creates an NTFS ADS file $GUID to store its GUID:

Unlike Anchor_DNS, which stores the information in Base64, Anchor’s GUID is saved in cleartext.

# Self Deletion

Anchor and older versions of Anchor_DNS implement the exact same self deletion routine using two sets of commands to ensure that the dropper is deleted once the malware was successfully deployed:



# C2 Communication

Similar to TrickBot, Anchor tries to establish Internet connectivity and the external IP of the target machine prior to communicating with its C2 servers. It uses the following hardcoded web services to test connectivity:

Once it has established connectivity, it communicates with a set of hardcoded C2 servers.

The request and response follow the same C2 communication format as TrickBot.

# Connecting** Anchor / Anchor_DNS to TrickBot

Anchor and Anchor_DNS are both directly linked to TrickBot infections, as they are downloaded by TrickBot as secondary payloads. There are also several other similarities noted below.

# GUID Generation Function

The GUID generation functions for Anchor_DNS and Anchor seem almost identical to that of the GUID generated by TrickBot. The GUID follows this pattern:

# External IP Check Web Services

Both Anchor and older versions of Anchor_DNS use a list of hardcoded online web services to determine Internet connectivity and check the external IP of the infected machine. The same list is also used by TrickBot:

checkip.amazonaws.com, ipecho.net, ipinfo.io, api.ipify.org, icanhazip.com, myexternalip.com, wtfismyip.com, and ip.anysrc.net.

In certain cases, if internet connectivity cannot be reached, Anchor and older versions of Anchor_DNS will delete themselves.

# Shared C2 Infrastructure

TrickBot, Anchor, and Anchor_DNS typically use a separate C2 infrastructure. However, in some instances of this attack, there was C2 server overlap between these infrastructures. For example, the IP 23.95.97[.]59, which is hardcoded in an Anchor sample, has also served Anchor_DNS and TrickBot:

Anchor sample with hardcoded IP (SHA-1: 9ebb541dcb24d564448a6f5e00c613b73eba7148)

# Connection to TrickBot

This above IP address was used by TrickBot to download the squlDLL plugin, which includes email harvesting from SQL servers, screenlocker, and Mimikatz.

# Connection to Anchor_DNS

The same IP resolved to a domain previously used by Anchor_DNS, chishir[.]com.
