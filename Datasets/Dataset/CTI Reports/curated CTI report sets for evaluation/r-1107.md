# Infection Chain

Our investigation started with the emails sent from an employee of the Administrative Office of the President in Afghanistan to the employees of the Afghanistan National Security Council (NSC). The email asked the recipient to review the modifications in the document related to the upcoming press conference of the NSC.



The email contains a password-protected RAR archive named NSC Press conference.rar . Extracting the archive with the password provided in the email requires user interaction and therefore provides a challenge for some sandbox security solutions.



The extracted file, NSC Press conference.exe , acts as a dropper. The content of the lure email suggests that the attached file is the document, hence, to reduce the suspicion of the victim running the executable, the attackers use the simple trick – the first document on the victim’s desktop is opened for the user upon the dropper execution.

Whether the dropper found a document to open or not, it will proceed to the next stage – drop the backdoor to C:\users\public\spools.exe and execute it.

# BoxCaon Backdoor Analysis

The backdoor contain narrow capabilities: download and upload files, run commands and send the attackers the results. However short the list, they allow the attackers to upload and execute additional tools for further reconnaissance and lateral movement.

To hide malicious functionality – persistence and C&C communication – from static detections, the malware uses a common obfuscation technique known as “stackstrings” to build wide char strings.

# Dropbox as a C&C Server

The backdoor utilizes Dropbox as a C&C server, by sending and receiving commands written to a specific folder in a specially created Dropbox account, prepared by the attacker before the operation. By using the legitimate Dropbox service for C&C communications, instead of regular dedicated server infrastructure, aids in masking the malicious traffic in the target’s network, as no communication to abnormal websites is taking place. The backdoor uses the Dropbox API with a hardcoded bearer access token and has the ability to download, upload, and execute files.

In the initialization stage, the backdoor creates a unique folder for the victim in an attacker-controlled Dropbox account. The folder is named by the victim’s MAC address which is obtained using GetAdaptersInfo API.



Locally, the backdoor creates a working folder at C:\users\public\<d> (where <d> is a random integer). It then proceeds by uploading two files to the server:
- m-<date>.txt – containing the backdoor execution path
- d-<date>.txt – containing the local working folder path.



When the attackers need to send a file or command to the victim machine, they place them to the folder named d in the victim’s Dropbox folder. The malware retrieves this folder and downloads all its contents to the working folder. Finally, if the file named c.txt – that contains the attacker command, exists in this working folder, the backdoor executes it using the ComSpec environment variable, which normally points to the command line interpreter (like cmd.exe ), and uploads the results back to the Dropbox drive while deleting the command from the server.

# Persistence

The backdoor establishes persistence by setting the HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows\load registry key to point to its executable. This method is less common than Run or RunOnce keys but achieves its ultimate goal: the program listed in the Load registry value runs when any user logs on.

# Post-infection

Once the C&C communication is established, the threat actor starts by executing fingerprinting and reconnaissance commands on the machine. In this attack, some of the actions we spotted included:
- Download and execution of ntbscan (SHA-1: 90da10004c8f6fafdaa2cf18922670a745564f45 ) – NetBIOS scanner tool widely used by multiple APT actor including the prolific Chinese group APT10
- Execution of Windows built-in networking utility tools
- Access to the victim’s files, especially documents located on the Desktop
