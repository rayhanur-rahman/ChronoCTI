# Infection procedure

# Initial infection or spreading

As pointed out in Malwarebytes’s public report, the actor sent weaponized documents to the victim as an initial infection vector. The documents use sophisticated infection methods to try to impede detection.

The initial infection can be summarized like this:
- The user opens the malicious document and subsequently allows the macro to be executed; 
- A popup message box appears; 
- The current document gets saved to the path %temp% as HTML and accordingly stores all image files separately within the same directory; 
- Show decoy document; 
- Convert %temp%[document name]\image003.png to the BMP file format and add the extension .zip; 
- Execute image003.zip, which actually contains HTML Application (HTA) code, with mshta.exe; 
- Remove previously created, temporary files.

The executed image003.zip is an HTML Application (HTA) file containing the second stage payload. This HTA code creates the next payload at the hardcoded path C:/Users/Public/Downloads/Winvoke.exe.

Besides the Microsoft Word document, the actor used an additional, alternative infection method according to our telemetry. Although we weren’t able to acquire the initial file, we assume the actor delivered a file disguised as a PDF, since we discovered artefacts containing the path of the tool ezPDFReader: c:\program files (x86)\unidocs\ezpdfreader2.0g\ezpdfwslauncher.exe. This software is developed by a South Korean software company named Unidocs. At this point, we’re missing clear evidence of whether the attack leveraged a vulnerability within this software in the infection process or it was used to deceive users by opening a PDF document as a decoy while the HTA payload is fetched from a remote resource.

Notably, the compromised website www.allamwith[.]com was used for a long period of time. We first saw the URL appearing in the context of this threat actor in September 2020 and it was still in use when we were researching this series of attacks at the end of April 2021.

When we analyzed the above malicious URLs, many of the resources had already gone offline, but the attacker is still using one distribution URL: hxxp://www.allamwith[.]com/home/css/skin.html

The URL hosts still serving the HTML Application (HTA) file exhibit similar functions as the HTA file created by the malicious Word document. However, in the case of remotely fetched HTA code with PDF-style attacks, the next payload gets dropped to a different hardcoded path, located at C:/users/public/iexplore.exe, and eventually executed.

# Second stage payload: Simple agent

The second stage payload is responsible for communicating with the C2 server and preparing another payload for the next stage. This second stage malware decrypts the embedded payload at runtime. It uses an embedded 16-byte XOR key to decrypt the base64 encoded payload. The decrypted payload is another portable executable file that runs in memory.

The infection procedure of the second stage payload:
- Create mutex named Microsoft32. 
- Resolve API address: base64 decoding + RC4 decryption with the key MicrosoftCorporationValidation@#$%^&*()!US 
- Retrieve C2 addresses: base64 decoding + custom XOR decryption. 
- Communication with C2.

According to the response from the C2 server, the payload is able to perform five actions:

The malware operator appears to deliver the third stage payload by using the above functionalities, as our telemetry reveals. Both second and third stage payloads also share an identical icon, which looks like Internet Explorer.

# Third stage payload: Backdoor

The third stage payload was created via the second stage payload, is interactively executed in the operation and exists in both x64 and x86 versions. Most of them use Internet Explorer or Google Chrome icons and corresponding file names to disguise themselves as legitimate internet browsers. The third stage decrypts the embedded payload and executes it. The embedded payload shows the same structure as the second stage payload discussed above.

Once launched, it checks for the mutex QD33qhhXKK and inspects the system for signs of a sandbox environment by searching for the presence of specific modules. The strings of module names to be checked are decoded with a hardcoded XOR key: 0x4B762A554559586F6A45656545654130
- sbiedll.dll: Sandboxie module
- api_log.dll: SunBelt SandBox module
- dir_watch.dll: SunBelt SandBox module

With the environment checks done, the main payload gets decrypted using the same XOR key and launched with rundll32.exe. Three C2 addresses then get extracted and decrypted using DES, with all addresses pointing to the same IP (23.229.111[.]197) in this sample. The malware then sends a hardcoded string to the C2 server: “HTTP 1.1 /member.php SSL3.4”.

Next, it checks if the C2’s response data equals “HTTP 1.1 200 OK SSL2.1” and, if positive, starts conducting its backdoor operations. The samples contain debug data and thereby expose function names disclosing their purpose:
- ModuleUpdate: Replace the current module with a batch file
- ModuleShell: Execute Windows command, changes working directory, Connect to given IP address
- ModuleFileManager: Get disk information, File listing, File manipulation
- ModuleScreenCapture: Take a screenshot

# Ransomware

Interestingly, one victim was discovered to have received ransomware after the third stage payload. This ransomware sample is custom made and specifically developed by the threat actor behind this attack. This ransomware is controlled by command line parameters and can either retrieve an encryption key from the C2 or, alternatively, as an argument at launch time.

We saw the malware executed with the following parameter options in our telemetry, with some parameters illustrated below: 

Upon launch, the ransomware checks the number of parameters. If the number of arguments is less than six, the malware terminates itself. If there is no extension for the encrypted files specified, the malware uses a default extension (.3nc004) and a default file name for the ransom note (3nc004.txt). If the victim ID is left unspecified, the ransomware generates a random ID 24 characters long.

If the malware is executed with the -s(-S) option, it sends the victim ID to the C2 server and receives the initial vector (IV) and key to encrypt files. Each of the strings has a length of 32 characters. When the ransomware communicates with the C2 server, it uses the same authentication process and strings as the third stage payload.

The ransomware uses an AES-128 CBC mode algorithm to encrypt files on the victim machine. With the exception of system-critical files (“.exe”, “.dll”, “.sys”, .”msiins”, and “.drv” extensions), the malware encrypts files completely, irrespective of file size. However, since important system configuration files are affected by the encryption procedure as well, it can lead to an unstable system.

As a final step, it leaves a ransom note on the desktop and in the startup folder and opens it with notepad.exe.
