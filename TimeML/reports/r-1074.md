# From Commodity Malware Infection to Ransomware

Since Egregor is a relatively new player in the game, not many incidents involving it are covered and detailed here, including information about the infection chain. The information available so far suggests that the initial infection starts with a phishing email that contains a malicious macro embedded in an attached document.

The macro code downloads a commodity malware, either Qbot icedID or Ursnif, which provides capabilities for stealing sensitive information that will later be used for lateral movement. This technique, which involves using a commodity malware as initial infection and to eventually deliver ransomware, was observed before with Ryuk ransomware and Maze.

Later in the attack, a CobaltStrike beacon is installed on the infected machine and the attack shifts to an interactive hacking operation. The attacker uses tools for reconnaissance such as Adfind and Sharphound to gather information about users, groups, computers and so on. This information will assist in the lateral movement phase and also in performing privilege escalation, as Egregor compromises Active Directory in order to become domain admin.

In this stage, after the malware settles on the victim’s machine, it starts communications to the C2 in order to download additional components including scripts, DLLs and other files that will be used eventually to exfiltrate data and encrypt files.

Among the dropped files observed:
- A batch file that is used to run Bitsadmin and Rundll to download and execute the Egregor payload.
- A Zip file contains a binary file that is an RClone client, renamed svchost, and RClone config files (webdav, ftp and dropbox) used later for exfiltration.



CobaltStrike creates a service that runs an encoded PowerShell command that executes shellcode that creates connection to amajai-technologies[.]industries:



After dropping the files needed for the attack, the attackers “prepare the ground” and undertake a final procedure meant to avoid detection and prevention. The attacker creates a Group Policy Object (GPO) to disable Windows Defender and tries to take down any anti-virus products.

# Egregor Execution

As described above, the operators of Egregor deploy the ransomware payload after collecting the sensitive information and setting the GPO to evade detection and prevention. To deploy the ransomware, they execute the dropped batch file that, as mentioned, is used to download and execute the ransomware payload from a remote server:



The Egregor payload can only be decrypted if the correct key is provided via command line argument to the Rundll32 process, which means that the file cannot be analyzed, either manually or using a sandbox, if the exact same command line that the attackers used to run the ransomware isn’t provided.

In order to execute the ransomware and decrypt the blob of code inside of it, the operators provide the batch file with the key “-passegregor10” which resolves in the ransomware running and encrypting files:



The encrypted file names are appended with a string of random characters as the new extension. For example, it renames a file named “My_files.zip” to “My_files.zip.IAsnM”, “My_files2.zip” to “My_files2.zip.WZlF” and so on. Also, the threat actor creates the “RECOVER-FILES.txt” with ransom note in all folders that contain encrypted files, as shown in the figure below:
