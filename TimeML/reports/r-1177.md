# Initial Access and Execution

Cybereason GSOC team observed the following distribution method to deliver the Bumblebee malware:
- A spear phishing email is received containing an archive or a link to an external source to download the archive.
- User extracts the archive and mounts the resulting ISO image.
- The content of the mounted ISO image is a LNK file executing the Bumblebee payload upon user interaction:



Bumblebee operators host malicious websites that implement a drive-by download. To infect the system, an end-user has to first manually decompress the archive containing the ISO file, mount the file and then execute the Windows shortcut (LNK).

The LNK file has an embedded command to run Bumblebee Dynamic-link library (DLL) using odbcconf.exe Living Off the Land Binary (LOLBin) and response (.rsp) file. The file [Bumblebee specific name].rsp has the reference to the Bumblebee DLL:





Odbcconf.exe loadsBumblebee DLL with the internal name LdrAddx64.dll. The figure below illustrates the ISO image content (DLL, RSP and LNK files) for Bumblebee:



Bumblebee DLL is executed using odbcconf.exe -f [Bumblebee specific name].rsp in the LNK file target property. [Bumblebee specific name].rsp has a reference to [Bumblebee specific name].dll which is the Bumblebee payload

# Foothold

After the initial infection, Bumblebee injects code into multiple processes in order to establish a strong foothold on infected endpoints. The process odbcconf.exe creates local Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) calls to spawn new processes.

As a result, the following two processes are spawned from wmiprivse.exe (Windows Management Instrumentation Provider Service) :
- wabmig.exe (Microsoft contacts import tool) with injected Meterpreter agent code (Meterpreter agent is a security product used for penetration testing and provides remote control capabilities).
- wab.exe (Microsoft address book application) with an injected Cobalt Strike beacon:



# Privilege Escalation and Cobalt Strike deployment

Bumblebee performs privilege escalation by loading an exploit for CVE-2020-1472 (Zerologon) into rundll32.exe:



Bumblebee uses a User Account Control (UAC) bypass technique to deploy post exploitation tools with elevated privileges on infected machines. The method uses fodhelper.exe which is a trusted binary, meaning Windows 10 won't show a UAC window when launched into execution:



Fodhelper.exe is used to run "cmd.exe" /c rundll32.exe C:\ProgramData\Cisco\[Cobalt strike].dll”,MainProc where [Cobalt strike].dll is a Cobalt Strike framework beacon and MainProc is the exported function to run.

Cobalt Strike is an adversary simulation framework with the primary use case of assisting red team operations. However, Cobalt Strike is also actively used by malicious actors for conducting post-intrusion malicious activities. Cobalt Strike is a modular framework with an extensive set of features that are useful to malicious actors, such as command execution, process injection, and credential theft.

# Credential Theft

After obtaining system privileges on the infected machine, Bumblebee performs credential theft using two methods detailed below.

First method used is Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) process memory dump. On Windows systems domain, local usernames and passwords are stored in the memory space of the LSASS process. Bumblebee dumps the memory of this process using procdump64.exe to access the sensitive information:



The second method of credential theft that Bumblebee operators use is registry hive extraction using reg.exe:
- HKLM SAM: The Security Account Manager (SAM) database is where Windows stores information about user accounts.
- HKLM Security: Local Security Authority (LSA) stores user logins and their LSA secrets.
- HKLM System: Contains keys that could be used to decrypt/encrypt the LSA secret and SAM database:



Bumblebee operators :
- Obtain registry dumps
- Compress the data
- Exfiltrate it over their network tunnel:



Bumblebee operators process retrieved credentials offline, attempting to extract cleartext passwords. The time between credentials theft and the next activity is approximately 3 hours.

# Reconnaissance

After the attackers gain a foothold in the organization network, they gather information in various ways. We have observed attackers using tools such as nltest, ping, netview, tasklist and Adfind to collect wide information related to the organization. The attackers collect information such as the domain names, users, hosts and domain controllers.

AdFind (named “af.exe”) is a publicly available tool for querying Active Directory and has been used by multiple threat actors:



During the reconnaissance phase, Bumblebee operators contacted more than 200 IP addresses and domain names within the organization. The most notable ones are Microsoft Exchange, Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) servers.

The following table summarizes the reconnaissance commands observed by Cybereason GSOC analysts:




# Lateral Movement

Bumblebee uses a Cobalt Strike agent for lateral movement. We can see multiple connections from the process to internal addresses on Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), on TCP port 3389:



Following the lateral movement, the attacker persists on the organization network using the remote management software “any desk”:

# Active Directory Compromise

After the attacker obtains a highly privileged user and its password, the attacker accesses the shadow copy. Shadow Copy is a technology included in Microsoft Windows that can create backup copies or snapshots of computer files or volumes.

Bumblebee accesses the remote Active Directory machines using Windows Management Instrumentation command-line utility (WMIC) and creates a shadow copy using vssadmin command. In addition, the attacker steals the ntds.dit file from the domain controller.

The ntds.dit file is a database that stores Active Directory data, including information about user objects, groups and group membership. The file also stores the password hashes for all users in the domain:



The following are the commands related to credential theft used to escalate privileges on the Active Directory:



In order to obtain maximum privileges on the Active Directory domain, the threat actor:
- Creates a shadow copy of the machine file’s volume
- Lists all available shadow copies and stored the result in a file.
- Copies the Active Directory database (ntds.dit) as well as registry hives containing credentials and sensitive data from the shadow copy.
- Compress the output directory for exfiltration.

# Account Creation and Data Exfiltration

The threat actor uses a domain administrator account obtained previously to move laterally on multiple systems. After initial connection, they create a local user and exfiltrate data using Rclone software.

User creation commands are as follows :
- net user [Attacker created username] P@ssw0rd!1 /add
- net localgroup Administrators [Attacker created username] /add



The rclone.exe process transfers approximately 50 GB of data to an endpoint with an IP address over TCP port 22 (SSH), which is located in the United States.
