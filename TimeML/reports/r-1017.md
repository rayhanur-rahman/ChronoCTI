# Initial Access

The specific sample analyzed below is the ChristmasCard.doc (SHA256: 1D751C9AA079CC2D42D07D7964D5FAE375127EFA6CA1AC2DFECFD481FE796FBC).

When a victim opens the document, Microsoft Word asks to enable/disable macros. It reveals that a macro is embedded in the document.

When a user opens the document, it claims that it was created in an earlier version of Microsoft Office and asks the victim to enable the content, which launches the code hidden in the macros.

# Execution

VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) codes in the embedded macro are given below:




The macro includes obfuscated VBA codes to evade security controls. The most interesting part of the macro is: Interaction.Shell(CleanString(nvTFDMcQuDSt.TextBox1), 15 - 15)

In this malicious macro, Interaction.Shell method runs an executable program written in TextBox1. However, TextBox1 is not seen by the victim, it is hidden in the document. We used the Debug.Print method to see the content of the Textbox1, and accessed the following code that is executed by the Interaction.Shell method:


We see a heavily obfuscated code to make detection difficult, the only clear part of the code is c:\SzCTnucwEfW\SbuaBlErrzYpl\RdPspAGt\..\..\..\windows\system32\cmd.exe. As seen on this part of the code, three random directories are added after c:\ to bypass weak security controls, then three \.. are added to traverse back to c:\. Therefore, the obtained path is c:\windows\system32\cmd.exe that runs the subsequent commands.

However, those commands are also obfuscated:



The second and third commands are interesting:



Briefly, these commands print 497 characters long XhOY variable in reverse order.

Let’s look at XhOY variable:


And, XhOY variable in reverse order:


Now, we can see it is a PowerShell command, but it is obfuscated by using variable substitution and garbage variable assignments. Even so, we can reveal the following command by removing the garbage variables, and putting the values ​​of the variables where they exist.


Briefly, this command tries to download 150.exe from the following addresses in given order via the Net.WebClient.DownloadFile method. Then, if the file is downloaded successfully it executes the downloaded file by using the Invoke-Item cmdlet, and exits the loop. It differentiates a successful file download by comparing the length of the file with -ge 80000 (ge: greater or equal than).



When we started to examine the 150.exe file (SHA256: 5456471B260E664E9485D2CB8321D8E3B3033F700A5BDAAFC94E4BA8046FB87D), we realized that it is the infamous Emotet trojan.

As expected from an Emotet sample, it tries to download a file from the following locations:



After a few failed attempts, it downloaded archivesymbol.exe (SHA256: 5DA7A92311FDA255EFAC52C6BFEBCED31BD584453F6BB4F8DE6CDD1B2505B00F) file from 201.190.150.60:443 to C:\Users\admin\AppData\Local\archivesymbol\ folder. Emotet artifacts usually mimic the names of known executables. In order to become persistent on the victim system, Archivesymbol.exe adds its full path to the HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run key in the Registry.
