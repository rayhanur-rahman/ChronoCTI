# Phase 1: Trojanized Installer Download

Mandiant Consulting observed the Trojanized installer downloaded on a Windows workstation after the user visited a legitimate site that the victim organization had used before.

The downloaded file was extracted to


Mandiant confirmed the user intended to download, install, and use the SmartPSS software. Figure 2 shows an image of the download page used for SmartPSS software.



# Phase 2: Nullsoft Installer

The installer executable is a Nullsoft installer that when executed wrote two files to C:\ProgramData\SMARTPSS-Win32_ChnEng_IS. We were able to extract the malicious installer script and files for analysis using 7-Zip. The relevant section of this installer script is shown below in Figure 3.



The installer script created two files: SMARTPSS-Win32_ChnEng_IS_V2.002.0000007.0.R.181023-General.exe (b540b8a341c20dced4bad4e568b4cbf9) and smartpss.exe (c180f493ce2e609c92f4a66de9f02ed6). The former is a clean installer from the original developer and is launched first, installing the software as the user may expect. The latter is launched with a command line URL executing the content.

The smartpss.exe file contained metadata describing itself as MSHTA.exe from Microsoft, a legitimate operating system component, but the MD5 hash was unknown. Disassembly analysis of the program showed it was a small application that loaded the IE COM object and launched the function RunHTMLApplication() against the command line argument provided. This functionality matched the behavior of the legitimate MSHTA.exe despite the hash discrepancy. Further analysis showed that the malware was based on a 2018 version of the binary (original hash: 5ced5d5b469724d9992f5e8117ecefb5) with only six bytes of data appended, as shown in Figure 4.



# Phase 3: Downloaded VBScript and PowerShell

Upon execution, the modified Mshta file was executed with the URL, hxxp://sdoc[.]xyz/ID-508260156241, and passed as an argument on the command line.

Domain sdoc[.]xyz was first associated with UNC2465 by RiskIQ in a May 20, 2021, blog post researching the infrastructure that Mandiant previously reported. According to RiskIQ, sdoc[.]xyz shares a registrant with koliz[.]xyz, which was also observed by Mandiant in past UNC2465 intrusions.


The execution of the modified Mshta file resulted in the creation of a HTM file called loubSi78Vgb9[1].htm that was written to a temporary INetCache directory. Mandiant was not able to acquire this file at the time of writing; however, Mandiant was able to recover partial contents of the file.



At the time of writing, sdoc[.]xyz appeared to be active, but not returning the VBScript code. It is not clear if sdoc[.]xyz was selecting victims based on IP or other properties or was simply dormant. A PCAP from a sandbox execution on VirusTotal from May 26, 2021, also showed benign content being served.



Shortly after the download, a PowerShell script block was executed to download SMOKEDHAM, as shown in Figure 6.



Within seconds, a file named qnxfhfim.cmdline was written to disk and executed using the Command-Line Compiler.


Mandiant was not able to recover this file at the time of writing; however, Mandiant was able to recover partial contents of the file.


After the execution of qnxfhfim.cmdline, PowerShell initiated the first connection to the fronted domain lumiahelptipsmscdnqa[.]microsoft[.]com used by SMOKEDHAM.

# Phase 4: SMOKEDHAM Dropper

The SMOKEDHAM dropper (f075c2894ac84df4805e8ccf6491a4f4) is written in PowerShell and decrypts and executes in memory the SMOKEDHAM backdoor. The dropper uses the Add-Type cmdlet to define a new .NET class for the backdoor. The Add-Type cmdlet can be used to define a new .NET class using an existing assembly or source code files or specifying source code inline or saved in a variable. In this case, the dropper uses SMOKEDHAM backdoor source code that is stored in a variable.

The SMOKEDHAM backdoor source code is embedded as an encrypted string. The dropper uses the ConvertTo-SecureString cmdlet and an embedded key to decrypt the source code prior to executing the Add-Type cmdlet. After defining a new .NET class for the backdoor, the dropper executes the backdoor's entry point. The dropper configures the backdoor with a C2 server address, RC4 encryption key, and sleep interval. Figure 7 shows the deobfuscated SMOKEDHAM dropper.



SMOKEDHAM (127bf1d43313736c52172f8dc6513f56) is a .NET-based backdoor that supports commands, including screen capture and keystroke capture. The backdoor may also download and execute additional PowerShell commands from its command and control (C2) server.

# SMOKEDHAM Network Communications

SMOKEDHAM communicates with its C2 server using HTTPS. The backdoor uses domain fronting to obfuscate its true C2 server. The fronted domain is configured by an earlier stage of execution and the actual domain is hard-coded in the backdoor. Mandiant observed the fronted domain lumiahelptipsmscdnqa.microsoft[.]com and hard-coded domain max-ghoster1.azureedge[.]net used for C2 server communication.

The communication between SMOKEDHAM and its C2 server consists of JSON data exchanged via HTTP POST requests. The backdoor initiates requests to the C2 server and the C2 server may include commands to execute in the responses. The JSON data exchanged between SMOKEDHAM and its C2 server contains three fields: ID, UUID, and Data.

The ID field contains a unique value generated by the backdoor for the target system.

The UUID field may contain a unique value used to track command output or be empty. When the C2 server responds with a command to execute, it sets the UUID field to a unique value. SMOKEDHAM then sets the same UUID value in the subsequent HTTP POST request that contains the command output.

The Data field may contain RC4-encrypted, Base64-encoded command data or be empty. The backdoor uses the Data field to send command output to its C2 server. The C2 server uses the Data field to send commands to the backdoor to execute. The backdoor uses an RC4 key configured by an earlier stage of execution to encrypt and decrypt the Data field. Mandiant observed the RC4 key UwOdHsFXjdCOIrjTCfnblwEZ used for RC4 encryption and decryption.

# SMOKEDHAM Commands

SMOKEDHAM Base64-decodes, and RC4-decrypts command data returned in the Data field. The backdoor checks if the plaintext command data begins with one of the following keywords, shown in Table 1.






If the plaintext command data does not begin with any of the keywords listed in Table 1, then SMOKEDHAM assumes the data contains a PowerShell command and attempts to execute it. The backdoor uploads output generated by the PowerShell command to its C2 server via a subsequent HTTP POST request.

In addition to supporting the commands in Table 1, SMOKEDHAM continuously captures keystrokes. The backdoor writes captured keystrokes to memory and uploads them to its C2 server every five seconds via HTTP POST requests.

# SMOKEDHAM In Action

SMOKEDHAM was observed executing commands on the target system using PowerShell.

The following commands were used to collect information about the system and logged in users.
- net.exe user net.exe users
- whoami.exe whoami.exe /priv systeminfo.exe

The following commands were used to create and add the DefaultUser account to the local Administrators group, and subsequently hide the account from the Windows logon screen.


The following commands facilitated lateral movement by modifying Terminal Server registry key values to enable multiple Remote Desktop connection sessions, and modifying the Local Security Authority (LSA) registry key value to require a password for authentication.


Additionally, SMOKEDHAM modified the WDigest registry key value HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\WDigest\UseLogonCredential to enable credential caching.

# Phase 6: Follow-on Activity

SMOKEDHAM used PowerShell to connect to third-party file sharing sites to download the UltraVNC application renamed as winvnc.exe, and a configuration file named UltraVNC.ini, shown in Figure 8. These files were saved to the %APPDATA%\Chrome\ directory. The UltraVNC.ini file allowed UltraVNC to connect to port 6300 on the loopback address specified by the parameter AllowLoopback=1.



SMOKEDHAM was observed using UltraVNC to establish a connection to the IP address and port pair 81.91.177[.]54[:]7234 that has been observed in past UNC2465 intrusions.


SMOKEDHAM created a persistence mechanism for UltraVNC by adding the application to the ConhostNT value under the current users Run registry key.


# NGROK Configuration

SMOKEDHAM used PowerShell to connect to third-party file sharing sites to download an NGROK utility that was renamed conhost.exe, and a script named VirtualHost.vbs that was used to execute NGROK with a configuration file named ngrok.yml. These files were stored in the C:\ProgramData\WindNT\ directory. NGROK is a publicly available utility that can expose local servers behind NATs and firewalls to the public internet over secure tunnels.




The execution of VirtualHost.vbs allowed NGROK to listen and forward traffic on TCP port 6300 through an NGROK tunnel, subsequently allowing NGROK to tunnel UltraVNC traffic out of the environment.

SMOKEDHAM created a persistence mechanism for NGROK by adding VirtualHost.vbs to the WindNT value under the current users Run registry key.


# Keylogger Deployment

This attacker utilized an additional keylogging utility named C:\ProgramData\psh\console.exe. The keylogging utility was configured to capture and record keystrokes to C:\ProgramData\psh\System32Log.txt.

Mandiant then observed the attacker use UltraVNC to download two LNK files that reference the keylogging utility. The downloaded files were named desktop.lnk and console.lnk, respectively, and were placed in the following persistence locations:


# Cobalt Strike Beacon

The attacker used UltraVNC to download an in-memory dropper for Cobalt Strike to C:\ProgramData\Cisco Systems\Cisco Jabber\update.exe. Update.exe was a Go based dropper created using the ScareCrow framework. The attacker executed C:\ProgramData\Cisco Systems\Cisco Jabber\update.exe using Command Prompt.


The execution of ScareCrow framework dropper C:\ProgramData\Cisco Systems\Cisco Jabber\update.exe resulted in the creation of a Cobalt Strike stageless payload to C:\ProgramData\Cisco\update.exe, which then established a connection to a Cobalt Strike Beacon server located at w2doger[.]xyz when executed.

Mandiant observed the attacker using UltraVNC to download and store a file named update.lnk in the %APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\ directory. Mandiant was not able to recover update.lnk at the time of writing, but suspects that this file was created to add persistence to the Cobalt Strike stageless payload.

# LSASS Dumping and Lateral Movement

Mandiant observed this attacker dump the LSASS process using Task Manager to a file named lsass.DMP, and later, zip the dump into two files named lsass.zip and lsass2.zip located in the C:\ProgramData\psh\ directory.

From this point, the attacker was observed moving laterally to different systems in the environment using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connections.
