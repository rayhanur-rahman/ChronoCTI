# Case Summary

Like in our prior two reports of Ryuk campaigns, the initial access came from phishing emails containing links to google drive that when clicked, downloaded a Bazar Loader backdoor executable. In our prior cases we generally saw a lag time, ranging hours to days, from the initial click to Ryuk. In this case, the time from initial Bazar execution to domain recon was 5 minutes, and deployment of Cobalt Strike beacons was within 10 minutes. This is by far the quickest we have seen them act.

After bringing in Cobalt Strike, we saw familiar TTP’s with using AdFind to continue domain discovery activity. In this case, we saw them deploy persistence on the beachhead host, an action we had not previously seen in our other cases. After establishing another C2 for an additional Cobalt Strike beacon, they employed the Zerologon exploit (CVE 2020-1472) and obtained domain admin level privileges. We also saw host process injection on the beachhead used for obfuscation and privilege escalation.

With domain administrator privileges obtained, the threat actors then moved laterally throughout the network using SMB and RDP to deploy Cobalt Strike beacons on the domain controllers around 1 hour after the initial execution of Bazar. On the domain controllers, some additional discovery was done using the PowerShell Active Directory module. From there, they targeted other severs in the environment; specifically, back up systems, file servers, and software deployment servers. After establishing Cobalt Strike beacons on those they felt ready to proceed to their final objectives.

At the 2 hour mark the threat actors made the move to deploy Ryuk ransomware by establishing RDP connections from the domain controllers to servers. This continued for the next hour until the entire domain had been encrypted, with that work completing just 3 hours after the first Bazar Loader was executed.

# Initial access

Initial access via a phishing email that linked to a google docs page that enticed the user to download a report, which was a Bazar Loader executable file instead Report-Review20-10.exe.

Execution of the initial Bazar Loader malware relies on user interaction.

Executables transferred over SMB during lateral movement were commonly executed via a service.



# Persistence

This time, unlike prior investigations, clear persistence was found setup on the beachhead host. Firefox.exe created these scheduled tasks as well as the run key.



# Privilege Escalation

The Zerologon vulnerability CVE 2020-1472 was again exploited to obtain domain admin level privileges.

# Credential Access

Rubeus was used to kerberoast the environment.

Process injection was used on the beachhead host to to inject into svchost.exe

The Bazar Loader malware was using a code signing certificate signed by Digicert under the organization NOSOV SP Z O O

At the time of delivery, the executable had a detection rate of 1/69 in Virustotal.

The Cobalt Strike beacons used in the environment used similar code signing certificates.

In previous cases, we generally saw some lag time between infection and further actions but this time things moved much quicker, starting with initial discovery executed by Bazar less than 5 minutes after initial execution.

Discovery command run by Bazar: net view /all net view /all /domain nltest /domain_trusts /all_trusts net localgroup "administrator" net group "domain admins" /dom

Seven minutes later, after launching a Cobalt Strike beacon, AdFind was used– running the same discovery pattern seen in previous reporting. This was started via a bat script. It appears that the threat actors are now piping these commands into a batch file one at a time instead of dropping adf.bat to disk.



Once on the domain controller the PowerShell Active Directory module was loaded.

# Lateral Movement

RDP connections were initiated from Cobalt Strike Beacons running on the beachhead host to two domain controllers and then Cobalt Strike executables were dropped by these connections.

In addition to using RDP to move around the environment execuatables were also transferred over SMB to ADMIN$ shares and executed as a service.



# Command and control

# Bazar Loader:

# Cobalt Strike (suspected):

# Exfiltration
Discovery data (AdFind and Rubeus outputs ) was exfiltrated out of the network via FTP.



# Impact

At roughly the 2 hour mark, we saw the threat actors begin to act on their final objectives. RDP connections were initiated from one of the domain controllers and the Ryuk executables were deployed and executed over these RDP connections. Servers such as the backup systems, file servers, and automation tools were targeted first, followed by workstations.

Commands ran prior to ransom execution:

While encryption was started 2 hours into the attack, by the 3 hour mark the actors had completed ransom of the entire environment.
