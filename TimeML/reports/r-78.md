We identified two lure ZIP files being used by Static Kitten designed to trick users into downloading a purported report on relations between Arab countries and Israel, or a file relating to scholarships. The URLs distributed through these phishing emails direct recipients to the intended file storage location on Onehub, a legitimate service known to be used by Static Kitten for nefarious purposes.[6] Anomali Threat Research has identified that Static Kitten is continuing to use Onehub to host a file containing ScreenConnect.

The delivery URLs found to be part of this campaign are:

File names in this campaign include:

Static Kitten’s objective is to direct users to a downloader URL (ws.onehub[.]com/files/7w1372el which downloads a ZIP file) via a phishing email that impersonates an EXE (تحليل ودراسة تطبيع العلاقات الدول العربية واسرائيل httpsmod[.]gov.kw.exe). This EXE purports to be a report on Arabic countries and Israel relations but, when executed, actually launches the installation process for ScreenConnect.

A similar second sample uses .docx file that tries to direct users to ws.onehub[.]com/files/94otjyvd which downloads a ZIP file called لدراسیة .zip. An EXE inside the ZIP of the same name will also begin the ScreenConnect installation process when executed. An overview of the infection chain is shown in Figure 1below.

# Lure Document Analysis

Static Kitten is distributing at least two URLs that deliver two different ZIP files that are themed to be relevant to government agency employees. The URLs are distributed through phishing emails with lure and decoy documents. An example lure is shown in Figure 2 below.

The .docx file shown in Figure 2 directly refers to government agency recipients while highlighting concerns about recent Iranian actions, the impact of the US elections, and joint studies by government entities on relations between Arabic countries and Israel. The actors reference multiple official agencies, including the General Secretariat of the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf and the UAE National Media Council, likely in an effort to add the appearance of legitimacy. A full translation of this document can be viewed in Appendix A. The hyperlink in the .docx file is impersonating the UAE National Media Council, however, the actual link directs to ws.onehub.com/files/7w1372el.

The second file is a ZIP called الدراسیة .zip (see Figure 3). We cannot determine the delivery method for this ZIP, but it is likely similar to the .docx email delivery method of the first download URL. The geopolitical-themed ZIP contains an EXE file with the same name that begins the installation process for ScreenConnect when executed (see Figure 4).

# Technical Analysis

# ScreenConnect and OneHub Context

Between 2016 and 2020, we have seenScreenConnect and Onehub used in malicious cyber activity by different, unassociated threat actors. For example, between 2016 and 2019 unknown threat actors targeted IT outsourcing firms, including compromising US-based Cognizant and India-based Wipro.[7] The actors responsible for these attacks used ScreenConnect to connect to endpoints on client networks, enabling them to conduct further lateral movements and automated actions on objectives. During an incident impacting Cognizant and their client Maritz Holdings, actors used ScreenConnect to propagate to other connected systems and caused over $1.8 million (USD) in losses through a gift card fraud scheme.[6] In 2019, another threat group used ConnectWise to execute PowerShell commands in their target environments. This lead to the delivery of Zeppelin and other VegaLocker ransomware variants, Vidar information stealer, Cobalt Strike beacons, PS2EXE tools, and banker Trojans.[7] In 2020, ScreenConnect/ConnectWise has been utilized by the cybercriminal group Pinchy Spider (GOLD SOUTHFIELD, GOLD GARDEN, Sodinokibi, REvil, GandCrab) to distribute Sodinokibi ransomware.[8]

Remote desktop management software is a common target and tool used by threat actors because of the wide variety of functionalities they offer. ScreenConnect offers three primary functions that each contain different valuable features for threat actors. ScreenConnect’s capabilities are shown in Table 1 below.

# First Executable



When a user tries to double click the executable تحليل ودراسة تطبيع العلاقات الدول العربية واسرائيل httpsmod.gov.kw.exe (Screenconnect payload), it drops the Microsoft installer file. This begins the installation of the client payload onto victim machines. While the actors attempted to make the installation appear legitimate, closer inspection of the client launch parameters reveals the potential for broader MOFA targeting. The client service launch parameters are: 

While the ScreenConnectclient agent is being installed, the server component expects a connection and the server can identify the client agent through a public key thumbprint. The thumbprint is a 16 character string located at "C:\Program Files (x86)\ScreenConnect Client (a97eeae2330a1851)”

Analysis of the authentic launch parameters passed back to the server as part of Screenconnect functionality is shown in Table 2 below.

The main launch parameter that indicates this EXE is designed to target MOFAs are the custom c parameters:

These parameters contain predefined properties that can allow an actor to know which target, or from where, has been infected. In this example the infected target is MOFA.

# Second Executable



The ScreenConnect launch parameters from المنح الدراسیة .exe is shown below:

The actors again created a custom field parameter, however, this one is kept to a generic MOFA targeting that appears as MFA: &c=mfa&c=mfa.gov
