# Initial Execution

Once executed, the SUNSHUTTLE backdoor enumerates the victim’s MAC address and compares it to a hardcoded MAC address value “c8:27:cc:c2:37:5a”. If a match is found the backdoor exits. The MAC address is likely a default MAC address for the Windows sandbox network adapter.

# Configuration

If the check is successful, the SUNSHUTTLE backdoor then enters a routine named “﻿main_define_internal_settings”, which handles creation of the configuration file if one doesn’t already exist in the directory from which SUNSHUTTLE is running. For the sample analyzed, the configuration filename is “config.dat.tmp”. The configuration data is Base64 encoded and AES-256 encrypted using the following key: hz8l2fnpvp71ujfy8rht6b0smouvp9k8

The configuration has the following example values when Base64 decoded and AES decrypted:

The configuration holds several values delimited by a “|” character, which are briefly described as follows.

If set in the configuration, the “blend-in” traffic occurs as the malware executes and transitions through its routines. The following URLs are leveraged for the “blend-in” requests:

# Session Key Mechanism

SUNSHUTTLE performs initial requests to the C2 in order to request and then retrieve what it internally refers to as a session key. The retrieved session key from the C2 appears to be RSA decrypted using the following private key that is embedded in SUNSHUTTLE and believed to be unique per compiled sample. Analysis is on-going on how the decrypted session key is used, but it is likely a session key used to encrypt content once SUNSHUTTLE transitions to its command-and-control routines.

After the configuration is created or read from, SUNSHUTTLE enters a routine named “﻿main_request_session_key”. The malware will iterate over this routine until it’s successful, sleeping a period of time after each iteration.

Inside the “﻿main_request_session_key” routine, SUNSHUTTLE constructs an HTTPS request to its configured C2. Upon an HTTP 200 response from the request, the response data from the C2 is expected to not contain the following string for the sample analyzed: ywQdjLuHHC

The request_session_key routine returns a 1 if the string is not in the response and a -1 if it is in the response. If the result of the request_session_key is 1, SUNSHUTTLE will execute the retrieve_session_key routine.

The retrieve_session_key routine again contacts the C2 and downloads content that is expected to be decrypted by the aforementioned embedded private key. The decrypted content is likely a session key used to encrypt content once SUNSHUTTLE transitions to its command-and-control routines.

# Commanding

Once a session key is retrieved from the C2, SUNSHUTTLE begins the beaconing and “resolve_command” routines in a loop. SUNSHUTTLE first issues a beacon to retrieve a command. After, SUNSHUTTLE will enter the routine “resolve_command”, which parses the response content to determine which command should be run. Available commands include remotely updating its configuration, file upload and download, and arbitrary command execution.

The content returned from the C2 after the “main_beaconing” routine is Base64 decoded and AES decrypted. A check is performed to ensure the decrypted content doesn’t contain the following string: Cp5RTQ31R1

As noted, it is likely these strings are unique per sample and randomly generated at compilation.

The decrypted content is parsed for certain unique strings.

# Files Dropped

After successful execution of the malware, it drops the following files to the victim’s system: <current_directory>\config.dat.tmp (MD5: Dynamic) Encrypted configuration file


# Persistence Method

The SUNSHUTTLE malware was not observed setting its own persistence. It is likely the persistence is set outside of the execution of SUNSHUTTLE.

# Network Communications

SUNSHUTTLE uses the cookie header to pass values to the C2. Additionally, a referrer is selected from the following list, presumably to make the traffic blend in if traffic is being decrypted for inspection:

The cookie headers vary slightly depending on the operation being performed. The following is an example request to the C2 from the “request_session_key” routine.
