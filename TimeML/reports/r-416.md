# Malicious Document Analysis

The malicious document contains two payloads as encrypted string arrays embedded in Visual Basic macro code. The payloads are present as encrypted string arrays that are decrypted in memory, written to disk and launched in sequence (second stage malicious binary launched first and then the decoy document).

The VBA Macro code is self-executing and configured to execute when the OLE document (MS Word doc) is opened (via “Sub AutoOpen()”). The AutoOpen() function in the VBA Macro performs the following tasks in the sequence listed:
- Decodes the target file path of the second stage binary payload. This file path is calculated based on the current user’s Temp folder location: temp_dir_path.\lsm.exe
- Decodes the second stage binary in memory and writes it to the %temp%\.\lsm.exe file location
- After writing the second stage payload to disk the VBA code performs two important actions. 
  - Runs the second stage payload using cmd.exe. This is done so that the cmd.exe process exists as soon as the payload is launched. This way a process enumeration tool cannot find the parent process => Smaller footprint. cmdline for executing the second stage binary: cmd.exe /c start /b temp_dir_path.\lsm.exe /haobao
  - Adds persistence on the system by creating a shortcut in the user’s Startup folder with the correct cmdline arguments:
    - Link file command line: temp_dir_path.\lsm.exe /haobao
    - Link File Name: GoogleUpdate.lnk
- Once the second stage payload has been launched, the VBA Macro proceeds to display a decoy document to the end user. This decoy document is also stored in the VBA Macro as an encrypted string array (similar to the second stage payload). The decoy document is again written to the user’s temp directory to the following filename/path: temp_dir_path.\Job Description.doc
- Once the decoy document has been written to disk, the VBA Macro sets its file attributes to System + Hidden
- The decoy document is then opened by the malicious VBA Macro and the original malicious document’s caption is copied over to the decoy document to trick the end user into mistaking the decoy document for the original (malicious) document.
- This activity, combined with the fact that the VBA Macro then closes the current (malicious) document, indicates that the VBA Macro aims to trick an unsuspecting user into thinking that the decoy document currently open is the original (malicious) document opened by the user.
- Since the decoy document is a benign file and does not contain any macros the victim does not suspect any malicious behavior.

# Implant Analysis

As part of the implant initialization activities the implant does the following;
- Checks the string passed to it through command line 

If the malware does not find this string in its cmdline arguments, it simply quits without going any further.
- Unwraps a DLL into memory and calls its one-and-only import using Reflective DLL injection. DLL information.

During our research, we discovered additional variants of the DLL file.
- As part of Reflective DLL loading the malware performs the following tasks on the DLL it has unwrapped in memory: 
  - Copy the unwrapped DLL into new locations in its own memory space. 
  - Build imports required by the DLL (based on the IAT of the DLL)
- Call the newly loaded DLL image’s Entry Point (DllMain) with DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH to complete successful loading of the DLL in the malware process.
- Call the actual malicious export in the DLL named “CoreDn”

All the malicious activities described below are performed by the DLL unless specified otherwise.

# Data Reconnaissance

The implant has the capability of gathering data from the victim’s system. The following information will be gathered and sent to the command and control server.
- Computer name and currently logged on user’s name, stored in the format ComputerName \ Username
- List of all processes currently running on the system arranged in format Process Name\r
- The presence of a specific registry key on the system HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Bitcoin\Bitcoin-Qt
- The malware appends an indicator (flag) specifying whether the above registry key was found in the user’s registry:

This key is checked again as part of the command and control communication and is sent as a duplicate value to the command and control in the HTTP POST request as well (explained in the below).

# Exfiltration

# Preparation

In preparation of the exfiltration of information collected from the endpoint, the malware performs the following activities:

Encode the collected information using a simple byte based XOR operation using the byte key: 0x34.

Base64 encode (standard) the XORed data.

Again, check for the presence of the Registry Key: HKCU\Software\Bitcoin\Bitcoin-Qt

# Command and Control Server Communication

Once the malware has performed all these activities it sends an HTTP POST request to the CnC server:

# Persistence

The persistence mechanism of the malware is performed only for the downloaded implant. Persistence is established for the implant via the visual basic macro code initially executed upon document loading by the victim. This persistence is also performed ONLY if the malware successfully executes the downloaded implant. The malware first tries to update the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE registry key.

If the update is unsuccessful then it also tries to update the HKEY_CURRENT_USER registry key. Value written to registry to achieve persistence on the endpoint:
