# TECHNICAL DETAILS

Maze is a complex piece of malware that uses some tricks to frustrate analysis right from the beginning.

The malware starts preparing some functions that appear to save memory addresses in global variables to use later in dynamic calls though it does not actually use these functions later. Whether it is residual code existing in the entry point of the malware or a trick to mislead researchers is up for debate.

Later, the malware enters in a big block of trash code that also includes some elements to decrypt strings and important information for later. The malware uses some tricks to detect debuggers at this point.

The most important of those are: A big use of the PEB field “IsDebuggerPresent”. This field is a Boolean field that is filled from Windows with 1 (True) if the application is running inside of a debugger or 0 (False) if it is not.


If the malware detects a debugger it will remain in an infinite loop without making anything while wasting system resources.


The malware gets all processes in the system but ignores the first one (the ‘idle process’ in Windows which is simply a tool to let the user know what percentage of system resources are being used). Using the name of each process it makes a custom name with a custom algorithm, along with a hash that is checked against a hardcoded list. If the hash is found in this list the process will be terminated.


For example, the process of the debugger “x32dbg”, is caught at this point:


It can terminate IDA debugger, x32dbg, OllyDbg and more processes to avoid dynamic analysis, close databases, office programs and security tools.

A partial list of the processes that can be cracked using a dictionary list terminated by the malware is shown below:

This short list shows the name of the process to kill and the custom hash from the special name generated from the original process name.

The malware will kill the process with the function “TerminateProcess” that it gets from the EAT (Export Address Table) of the module “kernel32.dll” to increase obfuscation, comparing the name with a custom hash taken from the name in high caps.

The malware calls Windows functions in a unique way to aid obfuscation, i.e. getting the first process in the system to use the function “Process32FirstW”. However, instead of calling it directly, it puts the parameters needed for the function on the stack, followed by a memory address with a “push” opcode and then makes a direct jump to the Windows function. When the function ends, Windows makes a “ret” opcode then gets the last memory address that the malware pushed inside the stack, returning to this address and continuing the flow. An example of this can be seen in this image:

Another ploy utilized by the malware (depending of the sample) is to get the function “DbgUIRemoteBreakin”, using the function “GetProcAddress”, before employing a trick to avoid having a debugger attach to it in runtime[7].

The trick used here is “VirtualProtect” to give the function memory address of “DbgUIRemoteBreakin” permission to write to it:

After gaining permission, which is granted only for 1 byte, the malware patches this byte with a 0xC3 value (the opcode of “ret”) and restores the previous permissions with “VirtualProtect”, again in the same address and byte, removing the write permission.

This is done to avoid having a debugger attach to it in runtime. This way, when a debugger attaches to the process internally, the system calls this function but, instead of creating a thread to start the debugging, the “ret” opcode forces the function to return without creating it. In brief, it prevents a debugger from being attached correctly. It is done before enumerating the system process.

The malware checks the language of the machine with function “GetUserDefaultUILanguage” and saves the value in the stack; it is not checked automatically after the call, but it is important later.

Maze creates a mutex with the name “Global\x” where x is a special value that is unique per machine. For example, in the next screenshot (some information has been deleted to anonymize the machine used for the analysis) is an example of this behavior. It is done to avoid two or more executions at the same time.

The malware, after creating the mutex, makes calls to the function “GetLastError” to check against two errors:
- 0x05 -> ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED. If the malware gets this error, it means that the mutex already exists in the system but, for some reason, the malware cannot access it (perhaps privileges, policies, etcetera).
- 0xb7 -> ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS. If the malware gets this error, it means that the mutex already exists in the system and can be accessed.

If either of the above occur, the malware remains in execution but does not crypt any files in the system or use any resources of the machine. It means that it will appear in the program list using 0% of the processor.

The mutex value changes either per sample or on a periodic basis to avoid the possibility of vaccines being made against it. The malware also has a command to avoid the ‘problem’ of vaccines which will be explained later.

After the mutex, the malware checks the language previously saved in the stack against, for example, language 0x419 (Russian from the Russian Federation, ru-RU[8]).

The checks are done in an obfuscated way within the jumble of the code that the malware has (in the virtual machine used here the Spanish language of Spain (es-ES) was used; it is the code 0xC0A that appears in the stack in the screenshot):

If the language matches any of those in the list below, the malware will clean the memory and exit the main thread without wasting any resources or making any files.

The malware tries to delete the shadow volumes in the system using the “wmic.exe” program with the switches “shadowcopy” and “delete”. Prior to this, the malware gets the function of “WoW64DisableWow64FsRedirection” with “GetProcAddress” and uses it to avoid redirection by default in 64-bit operating systems and calls it in a dynamic way.

The malware tries to delete the shadow copies two times, once before crypting the files in the infected system and secondly after crypting them.

This execution is done with the function “CreateProcessW” but, to increase the level of obfuscation, the malware is launched with this command:

As you can see in the image above, the malware uses a command with the name of folders that do not exist by default in Windows, except “Windows”, “system32” and “wbem”. It enters these folders but then promptly exits them using the command “..”, meaning it returns to the previous folder in the path.

For example, in the beginning it enters the folders “ydw” and “fdygg” but later returns to the root of the Windows installation unit with two “..” commands that lead to “C:\” in this case. It later concatenates with the “Windows” folder and continues with the same behavior to finally enter into “system32” where it calls the “wmic.exe” program with the switches to delete the shadow volumes. This is done to try obfuscating this call, though such suspicious behavior may cause an antivirus program to stop it anyway, but it is proof that the malware coders have skills in programming and a good understanding of Windows behavior.

It is important to understand that this “path” used in the command with non-existent folders is random and does not need to use the same number of folders to make the obfuscation.

After the deletion process, the malware gets the function “Wow64RevertWow64FsRedirection” using the function “GetProcAddress” and calls it in a dynamic way to leave the system in the same state as before.

Maze affects network resources too, using the functions “WNetOpenEnumW”, “WNetEnumResourceW”, “WNetCloseEnum” and “WNetAddConnection2W”.

The malware uses two algorithms to crypt the files, ChaCha which is based on the Salsa20 algorithm that is symmetric and, for protection, an RSA algorithm that is asymmetric

In each execution the malware creates a Public BLOB of one RSA key that will be used to crypt the part that holds the information to decrypt the files, and one Private BLOB with an RSA key that allows decryption of the information crypted with the public RSA blob created previously.


Just like other ransomware, this malware has an RSA Public BLOB embedded that will be imported to protect the RSA private BLOB of the victim. Only the malware developers have the RSA private blob to decrypt their public RSA Blob.

This key is protected with a crypto using a key of 32 bits and iv of 8 bytes using the function “CryptGenRandom” to avoid memory dumps but, later, it will need to be decrypted before use.

After this, the malware starts the procedure of crypting the files, searching in units, before importing the RSA public BLOB key generated in runtime. After this, it creates the ransom note prepared for this infected machine in the root folder and then starts looking for folders and files to crypt.

An example ransom note, with some data anonymized, is shown below:

The procedure to crypt the files is easy, with the malware taking the following steps:
- Check the existence of the file with the function “SetFileAttributesW” with the attribute “FILE_ATTRIBUTE_ARCHIVE”.
- Reserve memory to the file with a call to “Virtual Alloc” for the key and iv.
- Open the file with read and write permissions with the function “CreateFileW” with the flag “OPEN_EXISTING”.
- Get the file size with the function “GetFileSizeEx” (it is important for managing big files, “GetFileSize” is not good for bigger files).
- Create a file mapping with the functions “CreateFileMappingW” and “MapViewOfFile”
- Generate a random key of 32 bytes with the function “CryptGenRandom”.
- Generate a random iv of 8 bytes with the function “CryptGenRandom”.
- Reserve 264 bytes of memory with the function “VirtualAlloc”.
- Generate a new random extension for the victim file. Each file has a different extension but does not lose the original extension; the new one is appended to the old one. For example, “1.zip” becomes “1.zip.gthf”.
- Crypt the file with the ChaCha algorithm and the key and iv with the RSA public key generated in runtime.
- Write this new block with the key and iv to decrypt at the end of the file.
- Rename the file with the function “MoveFileExW”. That way it is not possible to use forensic tools to recover the files because they use the same sector on the raw disk. The malware does not delete the file using the function “DeleteFileW” and later create a new one with the crypted data. Instead, all changes are applied in the mapping directly, in memory, without using a file pointer on the disk to read and write, which makes the process much quicker.
- The image of the file is unmapped, and handles closed.
- The process is repeated with new files.

The list of folders that the malware avoids are:

The malware ignores these file extensions:

The malware also has a list of filenames that will not be crypted:

However, it does crypt the file “ntuser.ini” to prevent other ransomwares from crypting it. It creates the ransom note in each folder that it can.

When the malware finishes crypting all files it changes the desktop wallpaper to this image:

The malware tries to make connections to IP addresses that have been crypted in the binary to send information about the infected machine, as seen below:

It is important to take into consideration that the malware forges the POST string to make the connection with a random choice from a list of possible strings such as “forum”, “php”, “view”, etc., to make detection harder with IPS or other filters on the network.

The IP addresses are detected as from the Russian Federation but that does not prove that the malware came from this country; it could be deliberate misdirection but, with the language checks of CIS countries, it certainly appears possible.

The use of IP addresses instead of domain names is to avoid DNS resolutions that can be altered or redirected to a loopback, for example using the “host” file in Windows. This makes the trace of IPs more complicated and avoids having the connection blocked.

The malware uses this agent to make the connection, but it can change between samples:

From a memory dump we can extract the IPs used by these connections, as well as a curious string that talks about Lawrence Abrams, the admin of the web site “bleepingcomputer” who was contacted directly by the developers. It is not known why they included this email address because it has no relation to the ransom note and is not used anywhere else. Perhaps it is a means of mocking the administrator of a site that frequently reports on ransomware?

The connections to the C2C IP addresses, in a pcap using Wireshark, can be seen perfectly:

Maze has some strings in memory that are interesting and something that may be worth further analysis in the future:


The webpage for making the payment requested in the ransom note gives a price and verifies that all is correct.

Maze has a chat function to contact the operators and receive information about how to obtain the cryptocurrency required to make payment.

Of course, as with many types of ransomware, there is an offer to decrypt three images for free and that service has been verified as working:
