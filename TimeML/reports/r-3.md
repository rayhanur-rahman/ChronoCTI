# Stage 1 — Initial Execution
In mid-July 2019 I encountered with an emerging campaign delivering the Konni malware.

The threat actor behind the campaign leveraged a malicious macro-armed Microsoft Word document titled: “О ситуации на Корейском полуострове и перспективах диалога между США и КНДР” (translated to: About the situation on the Korean Peninsula and the prospect of a dialogue between the United States and the DPRK). Unlike the previously observed campaign, the August campaign potentially targeting Russian language speakers with an interest in Korean Geo-political situation, the lure document used in this campaign is written Cyrillic and contains content related to North Korean American foreign affairs.

When analyzing the document, we see that the internal codepage of the lure document is 949 — ANSI/OEM Korean (Unified Hangul Code). indicating that the actor who created the document used Korean keyboard layout. 
This is an indication that the author is a Korean native speaker.

The lure document contains VBA macro code with the following capabilities:
- Changes the font color from light grey to black — to trick the victim to enable content.
- Checks if windows is a 32 or 64 bit version.
- Constructs and executes the command-line to download additional files

The document contains 3 hidden text boxes. 
Each text box has a hexadecimal string constructed to a command that is executed once the document is opened by the victim.

Certutil is a living-off the land command line utility that can be used to obtain certificate authority information and configure certificate services. 
Threat actors usually utilize certutil to download remote files from a given URL. 
It also incorporates a built-in function to decode base64-encoded files.

CMD silently copies certutil.exe into temp directory and rename it to “mx.exe” in an attempt to evade detection and then downloads 1.txt from from a remote resource: http://handicap.eu5[.]org. 
The text file contains a base64 encoded string that is decoded by certutil and saved as 1.bat.

The threat actor removes tracks by silently deleting 1.txt from the temp directory and then executes 1.bat.

# Stage 2 — Privilege Escalation

The batch script acts as a second stage downloader and downloads two additional files, depending on the system architecture. Certutil is executed to download a txt file and decode its content. Decoding each base64 string (32-bit or 64-bit version) results in a cabinet file — setup.cab

The content of the cabinet file is then extracted into %temp% folder, and setup.cab file is deleted from the system.


Install.bat — acts as installer to ensure persistence and execute mshlpsrvc.dll.
mshlpweb.dll — acts as loader; responsible to elevate privileges.
mshlpsrvc.dll — final payload; responsible for data exfiltration.
mshlpsrvc.ini — configuration file; contains URL used by mshlpsrvc.dll

Both dropped DLL files are unsigned and packed with UPX packer.


To check level of permissions, the threat actor uses net.exe. if the current user has high privileges, install.bat is executed directly. Otherwise, mshlpweb.dll is executed using rundll32.exe.


mshlpweb.dll is a loader that uses a known token impersonation technique to elevate permissions and execute install.bat with high privileges. To gain higher privileges mshlpweb.dll execute the Windows Update Standalone Installer, wusa.exe. This process runs as a high-integrity process by default, since its set to auto-elevate within its manifest.


mshlpweb.dll contains an access token impersonation routine that duplicates the token of the high integrity instance of wusa.exe, and uses it to create a new cmd.exe process running under the security context of the impersonated user[2], which in turn execute the installer — install.bat.


# Token Impersonation Routine
mshlpweb.dll utilize a set of standard windows API calls to duplicate the token of wusa.exe and use it to spawn high integrity instance of cmd.exe. Higher privileges are needed to execute the installer, install.bat. The technique used by the threat actor is a full fileless UAC bypass named “Cavalry” that was leaked back in March 2017 to WikiLeaks as part of “Vault 7”, a series of leaks on the US CIA that included sophisticated privilege escalation techniques used by several actors in the wild since the leakage [3]. This technique also bypasses UAC with the “AlwaysNotify” settings.

Technique flow:
- wusa.exe is executed in hidden window using ShellExecuteExW;
- Handle to the access token associated with wusa.exe is created.
- The token object of wusa.exe is duplicated using DuplicateTokenEx. The threat actor pass “Token_all_access” as desired access, which combines all possible access rights for a token and creates a new impersonation token.

New SID with medium privileges is created and set with NtSetInformationToken to the new duplicated token to lower its mandatory integrity level.
Restricted token is then created and duplicated using NtFilterToken and DuplicateTokenEx respectively.

The new duplicated token is passed to ImpersonateLoggedOnUser.
An elevated cmd instance is spawned using CreateProcessWithLogonW function. The credentials passed as arguments to the function (Username: aaa, Domain: bbb, Password: ccc) are identical to the credentials specified in the UAC bypass implementation by FuzzySecurity, UAC-TokenMagic [4]

I used the James Forshaw’s excellent blog [6] explaining in detail how to bypass UAC using the technique above.


# Stage 3 — Persistence
When the installer is executed, it first stops COMSysApp, a service that manages the configuration and tracking of Component Object Model (COM)-based components, using sc.exe utility.
- COMSysApp service is first configured to autostart and the binpath of the service is set to svchost.exe.
- COMSysApp service is added under the “SvcHost” key as a preliminary step to its execution in the context of svchost.exe.
- The malicious DLL is added as a service DLL of COMSysApp.
- COMSysApp service is restarted.

Once COMSysApp service is restarted the malware is loaded in memory, and the batch file is removed from the infected system. The final payload (mshlpsrvc.dll), and its configuration file (mshlpsrvc.ini) are both copied into the system32 directory from the temp directory and then deleted.



# Stage 4 — Data Reconnaissance and Exfiltration
After ComSysApp service is restarted, a new instance of svchost.exe is spawned and loads the final payload mshlpsrvc.dll. mshlpsrvc.ini is a configuration file that was delivered together with mshlpsrv.dll in earlier stage of the attack. This file contains a Base64-encoded string with a custom key, the file is read and decoded by mshlpsrvc.dll to perform an outbound connection and download handicap[.]eu5[.]org/4.txt.


# Data Reconnaissance
Prior to execution of any recon command to gather information from the target machine, the default codepage of the console is changed to “65001” (utf-8)



The following information is gathered from the affected machine and sent back to the control server:
- System info using: cmd /c systeminfo >%temp%\temp.ini
- List of running process using: cmd /c tasklist >%temp%\temp.ini
- The temp.ini file is then compressed into a cabinet file and saved to C:\Windows\TEMP: cmd /c makecab “C:\Windows\TEMP\temp.ini” “C:\Windows\TEMP\temp.cab”
- The downloaded file, 4.txt, contains a base64 encoded string with the same custom key as used before. Following decoding, the file content appears to be the FTP credentials for the FTP service that acts as the command & control server for this attack. We’ve observed similar past campaigns where free FTP services were used as the C2 for other Konni and Syscon variants, staring from October 2017. [5]


# Exfiltration
The data is exfiltrated in the following way:
- The temp.cab is base64 encoded with the same custom key used earlier.
- Encoded temp.cab is copied to a post.txt under the directory C:\Windows\TEMP.
- files uploaded to the control server using “stor” command.
