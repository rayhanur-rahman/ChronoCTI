# Initial Compromise: the Modified China Chopper Web Shell

The initial indicator of the attack was a malicious web shell that was detected on an IIS server, coming out of the w3wp.exe process. An investigation of the web shell, later classified as a modified version of the China Chopper web shell, uncovered several attack phases and TTPs. The threat actor was able to leverage the web shell to run reconnaissance commands, steal credentials, and deploy other tools.


China Chopper is a web shell first discovered in 2012 that is commonly used by malicious Chinese actors. It is used to remotely control web servers, and has been used in many attacks against Australian web hosting providers. The web shell parameters in this attack match to the China Chopper parameters, as described in FireEye’s analysis of China Chopper. This tool has been used by several Chinese-affiliated threat actors, such as APT 27 and APT 40. It is important to note that this tool is widely available and can be used by other threat actors.

# Reconnaissance and Credential Stealing

The threat actor launched a series of reconnaissance commands to try to obtain and enumerate information about the compromised machine, network architecture, users, and active directory enumeration.


# Modified “nbtscan”

One of the reconnaissance commands was to run a modified nbtscan tool ("NetBIOS nameserver scanner") to identify available NetBIOS name servers locally or over the network. Nbtscan has been used by APT10 in Operation Cloud Hopper to search for services of interest across the IT estate and footprint endpoints of interest. It is also capable of identifying system information.


# Modified Mimikatz

Following the reconnaissance phase, the threat actor attempted to dump credentials stored on the compromised machines. The most common credential stealing tool used by the threat actor was a modified mimikatz that dumps NTLM hashes. This version of mimikatz did not require any command line arguments, most likely in an attempt to avoid detection based on command-line auditing. The dumped hashes were used to authenticate to other machines via pass the hash. We renamed this sample to maybemimi.exe.

Reverse engineering shows the similarity between maybemimi.exe and mimikatz.

# Dumping the SAM Hive from the Registry

In order to obtain credentials, the threat actor used another technique that can be seen in the below screenshots. They dumped specific hives from the Windows Registry, such as the SAM hive, which contains password hashes.


# Lateral Movement

Once the threat actor mapped the network and obtained credentials (through net use), they began to move laterally. They were able to compromise critical assets including production servers and database servers, and they even managed to gain full control of the Domain Controller. The threat actor relied on WMI and PsExec to move laterally and install their tools across multiple assets.

The following example demonstrates how the threat actor moved laterally from the first machine, compromised by the modified version of the China Chopper web shell, to other machines inside the network.



# Maintaining a Long-term Foothold and Stealing Data

The threat actor abused the stolen credentials to create rogue, high-privileged domain user accounts which they then used to take malicious action. By creating these accounts, they ensured they would maintain access between different waves of the attack. Once the threat actor regains their foothold, they already have access to a high-privileged domain user account. This significantly reduces the “noise” of having to use credential dumpers repeatedly, which helped them evade detection.

# PoisonIvy

A second method the threat actor used to maintain access across the compromised assets was through the deployment of the PoisonIvy RAT (PIVY). This infamous RAT has been associated with many different Chinese threat actors, including APT10, APT1, and DragonOK. It is a powerful, multi-featured RAT that lets a threat actor take total control over a machine. Among its most notable features are:
- Registry Editor
- Screenshot Grabber
- Credential Stealer
- Interactive Shell
- File Manager with Upload and Download Support
- Process Monitor
- Keylogging and Various other Surveillance Features


We assume the threat actor used PoisonIvy for keylogging and other surveillance features, as they had that functionality available to them as shown in the screenshot above.

The strain of PIVY in this attack used a DLL side-loading technique to stealthily load itself into memory. To accomplish this, it exploited a trusted and signed application. The PIVY payload was dropped along with the trusted and signed Samsung tool (RunHelp.exe) in the following manner:
- nullsoft installer package (NSIS) was created with a legitimate, signed Samsung tool in it. 
- Once executed, the installer script within the NSIS package extracted the Samsung tool and added a fake DLL with the same name as a legitimate DLL (ssMUIDLL.dll), which is required by the application. 
- The DLL contains a PIVY stager, which is then loaded by the Samsung tool. 
- After the fake DLL was loaded by the Samsung tool, it decrypted a blob payload in the same folder, which contains the actual PIVY payload. 
- It was able to achieve persistence by creating a rogue scheduled task.

PIVY’s use of DLL side-loading to abuse Samsung tools is not new, and has been reported previously by Palo Alto. In 2016 it was used to attack pro-democratic activists in Hong Kong, most probably by Chinese threat actors.

# Secondary Web Shells

In later stages of the attack, the threat actor deployed two other custom-built web shells. From these web shells, they launched reconnaissance commands, stole data, and dropped additional tools including portqry.exe, renamed cmd.exe, winrar, and the notorious hTran.

# Data Exfiltration

The threat actor exfiltrated stolen data using multiple different channels including web shells and hTran.

# Compressing the Stolen Data

In an attempt to hide the contents of the stolen data, the threat actor used winrar to compress and password-protect it. The winrar binaries and compressed data were found mostly in the Recycle Bin folder, a TTP that was previously observed in APT10-related attacks, as well as others. This threat actor is known to stage the data in multi-part archives before exfiltration.

The threat actor used the following commands to compress the data.



The contents of the compressed data was crucial in understanding the threat actor’s motivation for the attack, as well as what type of information they were after.

# hTran

In order to exfiltrate data from a network segment not connected to the Internet, the threat actor deployed a modified version of hTran. This ‘connection bouncer’ tool lets the threat actor redirect ports and connections between different networks and obfuscate C2 server traffic. There have been numerous reports of hTran being used by different Chinese threat actors, including: APT3, APT27 and DragonOK.

The threat actor made some modifications to the original source code of hTran. Many strings, including the debug messages, were intentionally changed and obfuscated in an attempt to evade detection and thwart efforts to identify the malware by antivirus and researchers.

Since the original source code for hTran is publicly available, we were able to compare the debug output to the original source code to show that it has indeed been modified.

printf is being called (dubbed by us as “looks_like_printf”) with output “C e.”. By looking at the original source code, we were able to identify that this is supposed to be “Connect error”.
