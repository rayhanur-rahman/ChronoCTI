<a name=gui><h2>5. Using the Toolkit GUI</h2></a>

The Toolkit GUI can be used by typing one of

<blockquote>
<code>
% pythonw gui.py<br/>
% python gui.py
</code>
</blockquote>

Use <code>pythonw</code> when available, <code>python</code>
otherwise. In both cases the wxPython package needs to be
installed. The GUI has three advantages over using the command line
version:

<ol>
<li>It is faster when using on a file-by-file basis because all
libraries are loaded either at start-up or when the first file is processed.
<li>It is easier to use.
<li>It allows the user to type some input and see what happens.
</ol>

The main disadvantage is that it is not possible to process all files
in a directory. Here's a screen shot:

<blockquote>
<img src="gui-1.png" width="800" height="480"/>
</blockquote>

There is no separate manual for the GUI, but usage should be pretty
straightforward. Functionality can be summed up as follows:

<ul>

<li>Use "Load File" to select a file to be processed. 

<li>Use "Load Text" to type in text. This will create a file in
the <code>data/in/User</code> directory, which is then selected as the
input file.

<li>Use the"Document Type", "Trap Errors" and "Content Tag" pull-downs
and text field to enter processing options. Setting the "Document
Type" option will set the "Content Tag" text field to the default for
the document type. It will also select the default components for the
document type. The default components can be overridden by checking
and unchecking the component check boxes. Note that the three
pre-processing components are all either on or off.

<li>Use "Process File" to process the input file conform to the selected settings.

<li>Finally, "View Results" will pop up a new window that displays the
processing results in a more informative way (the large text field in
the control panel just prints the result file as is). The buttons in
the results view control what is shown in it. There are two
exceptions: (i) the "Graph" button will start the Tango annotation
tool on the results file, showing a graph of the annotation and
including a "TBox" button which displays an alternative format, and
(ii) the "TBox" button doesn't do anything yet, in the future it will
provide a more direct way to the TBox representation.

</ul>
