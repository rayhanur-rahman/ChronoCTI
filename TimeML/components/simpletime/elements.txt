# Time expression elements are building blocks for time expressions. They have
# (1) a name, (2) a type, which is an indicator whether the definition is a list
# of a regular expression (LIST or EXP) and (3) a list of strings or a regular
# expression as the definition. The format is
#
#     'ELEMENT' NAME TYPE (STRING+ | EXPRESSION)
#
# The element is started with the 'ELEMENT' string, the name and the type are
# both on the same line as the ELEMENT' string, but the list of strings and the
# regular expression can be on the same line or on the following lines. Elements
# are separated by one or more white lines, the subparts of the elements are
# separated by spaces or tabs. Lines starting with a hash sign (#) are ignored.
