"""Initial experiments on loading the libraries.

Most libraries are now all Python code and are used through imports. The idea is
to have libraries defined independently from the implementation, defining a
syntax for all libraries (simple settings, rules, etcetera) and then read in the
libraries (which allows you to read only those libraries that are required).

The LIBRARY variable provides other modules a single import point from which all
settings can be accessed.
