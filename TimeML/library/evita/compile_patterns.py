"""compile_patterns.py

Take all the Evita multi-chunk patterns, compile them into FSAs, and save them
in pickle files in this directory.

The following files are created:

   BECOME_A_FSAs.pickle
   BE_A_FSAs.pickle
   BE_FSAs.pickle
   BE_N_FSAs.pickle
   CONTINUE_A_FSAs.pickle
   DO_FSAs.pickle
   GOINGto_FSAs.pickle
   HAVE_FSAs.pickle
   KEEP_A_FSAs.pickle
   MODAL_FSAs.pickle
   USEDto_FSAs.pickle

After creation these should be moved to the patterns directory.
