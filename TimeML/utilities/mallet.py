"""Interface module to Mallet.

Defines a couple of methods that create Mallet commands and a class that
provides an alternative interface.

cvs2vectors_command() creates a command that lets you take a file with lines
like below and create a binary vector file.

"""Some notes on classify_command()

Here is what line-regex and friends do (from sh csv2vectors --help):

--line-regex REGEX
  Regular expression containing regex-groups for label, name and data.
  Default is ^(\S*)[\s,]*(\S*)[\s,]*(.*)$

--name INTEGER
  The index of the group containing the instance name. Use 0 to indicate that
   the name field is not used. Default is 1

--label INTEGER
  The index of the group containing the label string. Use 0 to indicate that the
  label field is not used. Default is 2

--data INTEGER
  The index of the group containing the data. Default is 3

So we use the defaults for --name and --data and we can get rid of them. But
--line-regex is slightly different from the default in that the separator for
the 2nd and 3rd group does not have a comma in our case, just the space,
probably so that we can use commas in features. I experimented a bit with
--line-regex, for example trying:

--line-regex "^(\S+) (\S+) (.*)$"

This one fails for reasons I do not understand. I also wondered why this would
not be used on the model training side as well.

It does look like --line-regex can be removed.
