   Consolidated Freightways Inc. reported a 77% drop in third-quarter net income, citing expected losses in its Emery Worldwide shipping business. 

   The Menlo Park, Calif., company said net was $7.4 million, or 22 cents a share, down from $32.3 million, or 86 cents a share, a year ago. 
Revenue totaled $1.01 billion, a 43% increase from $704.4 million, reflecting the company's acquisition of Emery earlier this year. 

   Profit also suffered because of "intense" discounting in its long-haul trucking business, the company said. 

   Analysts had expected Consolidated to post a slim profit, and the company's stock was down only 25 cents to $30.25 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday. 
"They have to continue to tighten their belts," said Craig Kloner, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs amp Co.
