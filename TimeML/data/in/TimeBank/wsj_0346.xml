   The utility holding company said Hunter  will receive 390,000 shares of a new series of Cilcorp convertible preferred stock with a face value of $39 million for the businesses. 
Cilcorp  will  also assume $22 million of Hunter's existing debt. 
As part of the agreement, Cilcorp said it  will pay Hunter $4 million in exchange for agreements not to compete. 

   Cilcorp said the businesses  to  be acquired had revenue of $76 million for the year ended March 31.
