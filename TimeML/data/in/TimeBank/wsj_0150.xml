   A.L. Williams Corp.  was merged into Primerica Corp., New York, after a special meeting of Williams shareholders cleared the transaction, the companies said. 

   Primerica, which  had owned nearly 70% of Williams,  will pay about 16.7 million shares, currently valued at almost $472 million, for the rest of Williams. 
The financial-services company  will pay 0.82 share for each Williams share.

Primerica closed at $28.25, down 50 cents.
