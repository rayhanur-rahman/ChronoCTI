 Despite the recent possibility of military conflict with Iraq, oil prices  have  been falling, that's because of a worldwide glut of oil.
 Now with a diplomatic solution to the crisis seemingly at hand, get set for oil prices from the Brent north sea variety  to light swede crude to fall further.


 Oil prices  have come down from the middle of October from a twenty-two dollar barrel level down to the fourteen dollars we 're seeing today.
 that 's built up a heck of a momentum and that momentum  will look  to increase.
 ah next up is that thirteen dollar a barrel level we saw in the winter of nineteen ninety-four.


 Weakened oil prices  have  already made life easier for motorists at the gas
 pump.
 Gas prices fell nearly two cents a gallon over the last two weeks. That according to the Lundberg survey of ten thousand gas stations nationwide.
