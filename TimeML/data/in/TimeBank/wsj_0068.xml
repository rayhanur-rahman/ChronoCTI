   GOODY PRODUCTS Inc. cut its quarterly dividend to five cents a share from 11.5 cents a share. 
The reduced dividend is payable Jan. 2 to stock of record Dec. 15. 
The Kearny, N.J.-based maker of hair accessories and other cosmetic products said it cut the dividend due to its third-quarter loss of $992,000, or 15 cents a share. 
In the year-ago quarter, the company reported net income of $1.9 million, or 29 cents a share. 
The company also adopted an anti-takeover plan.
