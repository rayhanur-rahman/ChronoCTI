   Hadson Corp. said it expects to report a third-quarter net loss of $17 million to $19 million because of special reserves and continued low natural-gas prices. 

   The Oklahoma City energy and defense concern said it will record a $7.5 million reserve for its defense group, including a $4.7 million charge related to problems under a fixed-price development contract and $2.8 million in overhead costs that wo n't be reimbursed. 

   In addition, Hadson said it will write off about $3.5 million in costs related to international exploration leases where exploration efforts have been unsuccessful. 

   The company also cited interest costs and amortization of goodwill as factors in the loss. 

   A year earlier, net income was $2.1 million, or six cents a share, on revenue of $169.9 million.
