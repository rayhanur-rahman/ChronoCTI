 Thousands of people in Germany have been demonstrating
 today against the high level of unemployment in the country.
 Latest figures show a sharp rise, with nearly five million
 Germans out of work.
 Caroline Wyatt reports.


 Chanting Helmut Kohl must go the unemployed took to the
 streets of the German capital, Berlin, mirroring protests
 around the country.
 Joblessness is now at its highest level in Germany since the
 second world war.
 With the general election due this September, record figures
 could n't have come at a worst time for Chancellor Kohl.
 His promise to half unemployment by the year two thousand has now been abandoned.
 And the German electorate appears increasingly eager to dispense with the services of Europe's longest serving leader.
 Caroline Wyatt, BBC news, Bonn.
