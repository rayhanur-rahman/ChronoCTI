   CAMBREX Corp., Bayonne, N.J., declared its initial quarterly of five cents a share, payable Dec. 1 to stock of record Nov. 10. 
The maker of specialty chemicals has about 5.9 million shares outstanding. 
The company said the move recognizes its strong financial position. 
Although profits were " squeezed" in 1989, mainly as a result of higher raw-material costs, the company said it is confident about future earnings and cash flow for 1990 and beyond. 
In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Cambrex shares rose 50 cents to close at $13 a share.
