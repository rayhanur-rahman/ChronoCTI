Entry Date: September 29, 2005
A major tropical storm arrived from the Gulf Coast on Septemeber 22. Gale forece winds over 90 miles an hour upgraded the storm to hurricane status 09/25/2005.  Hurrican Katrina made landfall in Florida, and rapidly devasted the western Mississippi coastline, and after gathering both wind strength and water for two more days, it hit Louisiana as a Category 3 hurricane on September 29, 2005.  The following day, levees bordering canals in New Orleans and along Lake Pontchartrain collapsed, causing major flooding in the 7th and 9th wards of that great city.
