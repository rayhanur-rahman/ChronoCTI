(see Lebanon: 10 April 2006: Reported Plot to Assassinate Hizbollah Chief in Lebanon). The alleged plotters, made up of Lebanese and Palestinians, some of whom are thought to be related through marriage will undergo further questioning today by Lebanese military prosecutors. Jamal Zaaroura, a Palestinian woman whose name has appeared in previous plots, and who is claimed to hold a Tunisian passport, is accused of being the 'ringleader'.  </Para><Para>Significance: Details surrounding this story remain very sketchy. Zaaroura, the alleged ringleader of this latest plot, was already indicted on charges of 'spying for Israel' in 2004, and sentenced to hard labour by a military court in 2004, making it all the more important to approach this story with a healthy dose of caution.  </Para></LeadPara></HandL><Byline index='field' fid='by'>Anoushka Marashlian  </Byline><Credit index='field' fid='cr'></Credit><Contact index='field' fid='ct'></Contact><Notes index='field' fid='rf'></Notes><Art index='field' fid='art'></Art><Copyright index='field' fid='cy'>Copyright 2006, Global Insight Limited.
